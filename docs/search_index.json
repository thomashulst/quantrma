This textbook was adapted from “Answering questions with data” by Mattew J.C. Crump. Adapted is maybe to generous of a word. In fact, most of the text was copied verbatim from the original source with minor changes to suit the learning environment at EUC. The original text is part of a larger OER (Open Educational Resource) course for teaching undergraduate statistics in psychology. As such, the text assumes you are a psychology student and many of the examples are drawn from the field of psychology. This does not mean that this course is only useful for you if you have an interest in psychology. The field of psychology will serve as a vehicle to teach you important concepts and skills in quantitative research methods and data analysis, but the concepts and skills taught are universal.

To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very rarely the favorite part of one’s bachelor studies. After all, if you really loved the idea of doing statistics, you’d probably be enrolled in a statistics program right now, not a university college. So, not surprisingly, there’s a pretty large proportion of the student base that isn’t happy about the fact university studies have so much statistics in it. In view of this, I thought that the right place to start might be to answer some of the more common questions that people have about statistics… A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. What is it? What’s it there for? And why are scientists so bloody obsessed with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it. So let’s start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be bizarrely fixated on running statistical tests on everything. In fact, we use statistics so often that we sometimes forget to explain to people why we do. It’s a kind of article of faith among scientists – and especially social scientists – that your findings can’t be trusted until you’ve done some statistics. Undergraduate students might be forgiven for thinking that we’re all completely mad, because no-one takes the time to answer one very simple question: Why do you do statistics? Why don’t scientists just use common sense? It’s a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. There’s a lot of good answers to it, but for my money, the best answer is a really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we’re human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using “common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists don’t think this approach is likely to work. Is it plausible to think that this “common sense” approach is very trustworthy? Verbal arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have biases – some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily because they’re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, but hard to explain in words). The instincts of our “gut” aren’t designed to solve scientific problems, they’re designed to handle day to day inferences – and given that biological evolution is slower than cultural change, we should say that they’re designed to solve the day to day problems for a different world than the one we live in. Most fundamentally, reasoning sensibly requires people to engage in “induction”, making wise guesses and going beyond the immediate evidence of the senses to make generalisations about the world. If you think that you can do that without being influenced by various distractors, well, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you. Heck, as the next section shows, we can’t even solve “deductive” problems (ones where no guessing is required) without being influenced by our pre-existing biases. 1.1 The curse of belief bias People are mostly pretty smart. We’re certainly smarter than the other species that we share the planet with (though many people might disagree). Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. That doesn’t make us perfect though. And among the many things that psychologists have shown over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example of this is the belief bias effect in logical reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldn’t. For instance, here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is believable: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) The logical structure of argument #2 is identical to the structure of argument #1, and they’re both valid. However, in the second argument, there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result it’s probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But that’s entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand: an argument is deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid argument doesn’t have to involve true statements. On the other hand, here’s an invalid argument that has a believable conclusion: No addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion: No cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-existing biases about what is true and what isn’t, and purely evaluate an argument on its logical merits. We’d expect 100% of people to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that the invalid arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at this, you’d expect to see data like this: conlusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 100% say “valid” 100% say “valid” argument is invalid 0% say “valid” 0% say “valid” If the data looked like this (or even a good approximation to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts. That is, it’d be perfectly okay just to let scientists evaluate data based on their common sense, and not bother with all this murky statistics stuff. By now you probably know where this is going. In a classic study, Evans, Barston, and Pollard (1983) ran an experiment looking at exactly this. What they found is that when pre-existing biases (i.e., beliefs) were in agreement with the structure of the data, everything went the way you’d hope: conlusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say “valid” – argument is invalid – 8% say “valid” Not perfect, but that’s pretty good. But look what happens when our intuitive feelings about the truth of the conclusion run against the logical structure of the argument: conlusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say “valid” 46% say “valid” argument is invalid 92% say “valid” 8% say “valid” Oh dear, that’s not as good. Apparently, when people are presented with a strong argument that contradicts our pre-existing beliefs, we find it pretty hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did so 46% of the time). Even worse, when people are presented with a weak argument that agrees with our pre-existing biases, almost no-one can see that the argument is weak (people got that one wrong 92% of the time!) If you think about it, it’s not as if these data are horribly damning. Overall, people did do better than chance at compensating for their prior biases, since about 60% of people’s judgements were correct (you’d expect 50% by chance). Even so, if you were a professional “evaluator of evidence”, and someone came along and offered you a magic tool that improves your chances of making the right decision from 60% to (say) 95%, you’d probably jump at it, right? Of course you would. Thankfully, we actually do have a tool that can do this. But it’s not magic, it’s statistics. So that’s reason #1 why scientists love statistics. It’s just too easy for us to “believe what we want to believe”; so if we want to “believe in the data” instead, we’re going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control. That’s what statistics does: it helps keep us honest. 1.2 The cautionary tale of Simpson’s paradox The following is a true story (I think…). In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley had some worries about the admissions of students into their postgraduate courses. Specifically, the thing that caused the problem was that the gender breakdown of their admissions, which looked like this: Number of applicants Percent admitted Males 8442 44% Females 4321 35% and they were worried about being sued. Given that there were nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in admission rates between males and females is just way too big to be a coincidence. Pretty compelling data, right? And if I were to say to you that these data actually reflect a weak bias in favour of women (sort of!), you’d probably think that I was either crazy or sexist.2 When people started looking more carefully at the admissions data (Bickel, Hammel, and O’Connell 1975) they told a rather different story. Specifically, when they looked at it on a department by department basis, it turned out that most of the departments actually had a slightly higher success rate for female applicants than for male applicants. The table below shows the admission figures for the six largest departments (with the names of the departments removed for privacy reasons): Table 1.1: Admission figures for the six largest departments by gender Department Male Applicants Male Percent Admitted Female Applicants Female Percent admitted A 825 62% 108 82% B 560 63% 25 68% C 325 37% 593 34% D 417 33% 375 35% E 191 28% 393 24% F 272 6% 341 7% Remarkably, most departments had a higher rate of admissions for females than for males! Yet the overall rate of admission across the university for females was lower than for males. How can this be? How can both of these statements be true at the same time? Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments (e.g., engineering, chemistry) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., English) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get A\\(&gt;\\)B\\(&gt;\\)D\\(&gt;\\)C\\(&gt;\\)F\\(&gt;\\)E (the “easy” departments are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of female applicants produces a quite different ordering C\\(&gt;\\)E\\(&gt;\\)D\\(&gt;\\)F\\(&gt;\\)A\\(&gt;\\)B. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to “harder” departments. And in fact, if we look at all Figure 1.1 we see that this trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as Simpson’s paradox. It’s not common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe that it’s real. It is very real. And while there are lots of very subtle statistical lessons buried in there, I want to use it to make a much more important point …doing research is hard, and there are lots of subtle, counterintuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. That’s reason #2 why scientists love statistics, and why we teach research methods. Because science is hard, and the truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data. Figure 1.1: The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the admission rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female applicant, as a function of the percentage of applicants that were female. The plot is a redrawing of Figure 1 from Bickel et al. (1975). Circles plot departments with more than 40 applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total number of applicants. The crosses plot department with fewer than 40 applicants. Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class. Statistics only solves part of the problem. Remember that we started all this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the “aggregated” data, it did seem like the university was discriminating against women, but when we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. From a legal perspective, that would probably put the university in the clear. Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual department (and there are good reasons to do that), and at the level of individual departments, the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the university can’t dictate which departments people choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce. But that’s not exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we’re interested in this from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask why there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this reversed for the English department? And why is it it the case that the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and females prefer “humanities”. And suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the government doesn’t want to fund the humanities (spots in Ph.D. programs, for instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty blatantly gender biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested in the decision making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably only interested in the disaggregated data. In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about your data, no more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but there’s no substitute for careful thought. 1.3 Statistics in psychology3 I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so focused on statistics. But I’m guessing that you have a lot more questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So here’s my attempt to answer a few of them… Why does psychology have so much statistics? To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of which are better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is a statistical science. What I mean by that is that the “things” that we study are people. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly perverse people. The “things” of physics include objects like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons don’t have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they don’t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set. At a fundamental level psychology is harder than physics. Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists. There’s actually a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that “if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment”. They have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are pathetically simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. It’s not just psychology, really: most social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics. Not because we’re bad experimenters, but because we’ve picked a harder problem to solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it. Can’t someone else do the statistics? To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view, there’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic statistics: There’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological studies, you need to at least understand the basics of stats. If you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics. There’s a big practical problem with being dependent on other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is expensive. In almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money to afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you have to be pretty self-sufficient. Note that a lot of these reasons generalize beyond researchers. If you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on statistics. I don’t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need statistics? Okay, now you’re just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter to you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics should matter to everyone: we live in the 21st century, and data are everywhere. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! 1.4 Statistics in everyday life “We are drowning in information, but we are starved for knowledge” – Various authors, original probably John Naisbitt When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call a statistical topic; 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error, if you’re curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some characteristic Y, but doesn’t say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!) The point I’m trying to make here isn’t that journalists are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), it’s that a basic knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to you. Perhaps, one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet on a far more frequent basis :). 1.5 There’s more to research methods than statistics So far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. However, about 99% of student fears relate to the statistics part of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this discussion, and hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent. But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of research, the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic and specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. Throughout the course you will be introduced to some core principles of research methods, but research methodology is an incredibly extensive and diverse field. To the extent that it’s the details of research methods that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory class, as is the case for this course. 1.6 A brief introduction to research methods In this section, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas that go into designing a study, collecting data, checking whether your data collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough information to allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of the basic tools that you need to assess the studies done by other people. However, since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note that this section is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more psychology-specific than the later parts of this book. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the problem in at least some detail. This section relies heavily on Campbell and Stanley (1963) for the discussion of study design. 1.7 Some thoughts about measurement The first thing to understand is data collection can be thought of as a kind of measurement. That is, in psychological research, what we’re trying to do is measure something about human behaviour. What do I mean by “measurement”? Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of well-defined descriptions to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count as a psychological measurement: My age is 32 years. I do like anchovies. My chromosomal gender is male. My self-identified gender is male. In the short list above, the bolded part is “the thing to be measured”, and the italicized part is “the measurement itself”. In fact, we can expand on this a little bit, by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case: My age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 …, etc. The upper bound on what my age could possibly be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice you’d be safe in saying that the largest possible age is 150, since no human has ever lived that long. When asked if I like anchovies, I might have said that I do, or I do not, or I have no opinion, or I sometimes do. My chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX), but there are a few other possibilities. I could also have Klinfelter’s syndrome (XXY), which is more similar to male than to female. And I imagine there are other possibilities too. My self-identified gender is also very likely to be male or female, but it doesn’t have to agree with my chromosomal gender. I may also choose to identify with neither, or to explicitly call myself transgender. As you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a bit tricky. But I want to point out that even in the case of someone’s age, it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above, I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you’re a developmental psychologist, that’s way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is important. Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of “age” isn’t actually all that precise. In general, when we say “age” we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that “birth” is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In one sense, yes: by social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world, but from a scientific perspective that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it’s often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of time since conception, and the length of time since birth. When dealing with adults, it won’t make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it might. Moving beyond these issues, there’s the question of methodology. What specific “measurement method” are you going to use to find out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities: You could just ask people “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age. You could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) “how old is your child?” This method is fast, and when dealing with kids it’s not all that hard since the parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception”, since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g., an obstetrician). You could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time consuming and annoying, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now dead). 1.8 Operationalization: defining your measurement All of the ideas discussed in the previous section all relate to the concept of operationalization. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalization is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept, and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of operationalization can involve several different things: Being precise about what you are trying to measure: For instance, does “age” mean “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research? Determining what method you will use to measure it: Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you’re using self-report, how will you phrase the question? Defining the set of the allowable values that the measurement can take: Note that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, hours? Etc. For other types of measurements (e.g., gender), the values aren’t numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only “male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people any specific options, and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers? Operationalization is a tricky business, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. The way in which you choose to operationalize the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often you’ll find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalization needs to be thought through on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general. Before moving on, I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process introduce more terms. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other: A theoretical construct or concept. This is the thing that you’re trying to take a measurement of, like “age”, “gender” or an “opinion”. A theoretical construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re actually a bit vague. A measure. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure. A variable. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” that we end up with in our data sets. An operationalization. The term operationalization refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct. The process of operationalization consists of two steps, each of which entails some kind of definition of the theoretical construct we are interested in measuring. The first step of operationalization is specifying the nominal definition of a theoretical construct. This is when you specify the meaning of a theoretical construct but remain quite abstract. For instance, when defining “children”, we could be asking the following questions: is a child defined by a blood relationship, a legal relationship, a social relationship, chronological age, level of dependency or some other criterion? Different nominal definitions will produce different results; hence it is important that nominal definitions are derived carefully and transparently. Usually, it is good practice to develop and narrow down a nominal definition as follows: Obtain a range of different definitions: search the (academic) literature for explicit and implicit definitions. Decide on a definition: from your list, either pick one definition, or create a new one that serves the purposes of your study best. Explain and justify your approach. Delineate the dimensions of the theoretical construct. Almost any theoretical construct has a number of dimensions associated with it and it is helpful to spell these out as they can help you get closer to the measure that best serves the purposes of your study. For example, the theoretical construct “child’s well-being” has a number of dimensions: emotional, psychological, physical, educational, financial, social, environmental, legal, etc. If you are interested in the effect of marriage breakdown on children’s well-being, which dimensions are relevant to you? You may examine all of the possible dimensions or limit yourself to one or two. To answer this question you can borrow from literature and theoretical frameworks used by other researchers to motivate and explain the context of research. What is most important is that you explain and justify your approach. In addition to the aforementioned dimensions, theoretical constructs can also have subdimensions. Suppose we decide to focus on social well-being. In this case, the following subdimensions could be of some relevance: the level of safety in the neighborhood or the nature of a child’s relationships and experiences with discrimination. Given that we are interested in the effect of marriage breakdown on children’s well-being, we might want to focus on the child’s relationships with others, especially people like their mother, father, siblings, etc. Again, what is important here is to explain and justify your approach. Figure 1.2: Operationalization of a child’s well-being. Adapted from Vaus (2001) The next step of operationalization is specifying the operational definition of a theoretical construct. This specifies the indicators that reflect the nominal definition. Working with our example of marriage breakdown on children’s well-being and our decision to focus on social well-being and a child’s relationship with his or her father, we can use the following indicators: amount of contact, level of conflict, feelings of closeness, amount of helping, type of activities engaged in. How well the indicators match the theoretical construct has a bit impact on the value of the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. Once the indicators have been chosen, the researcher can move to the next stage which is to measure the chosen indicators. In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to try to understand the differences. 1.9 Assessing the reliability and validity of a measurement At this point we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalize a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure. Now, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is. Reliability is actually a very simple concept: it refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable: if I step on and off the scales over and over again, it’ll keep giving me the same answer. Measuring my intelligence by means of “asking my mom” is very unreliable: some days she tells me I’m a bit thick, and other days she tells me I’m a complete moron. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to it’s validity). If I’m holding a sack of potatos when I step on and off of the bathroom scales, the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn’t match up to my true weight at all, therefore it’s wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, while my mom’s estimate of my intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe I’m just not too bright, and so while her estimate of my intelligence fluctuates pretty wildly from day to day, it’s basically right. So that would be an unreliable but valid measure. Of course, to some extent, notice that if my mum’s estimates are too unreliable, it’s going to be very hard to figure out which one of her many claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity. Okay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s have a think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability: Test-retest reliability. This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get a the same answer? Inter-rater reliability. This relates to consistency across people: if someone else repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce the same answer? Parallel forms reliability. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements: if I use a different set of bathroom scales to measure my weight, does it give the same answer? Internal consistency reliability. If a measurement is constructed from lots of different parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers? Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. Many courses at EUC have an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes; so the exam on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measure the same thing! 1.10 Forms of measurement error The aim of the process of operationalization is to identify measures with the highest possible validity and reliability. However, such endeavors turn out to be trickier in practice than they sound in theory and several errors might occur along the way. As we will see here, different forms of measurement error have different implications and consequences in the conclusions of the study. The first and least harmful form of error is random error. As the name suggests, it occurs randomly which means there is no systematic pattern underlying its occurrence. For instance, if we employ a self-reported measure of conflict with one’s own father, participants in our study might overestimate or underestimate the actual level of conflict with their father. If we believe that people are equally likely to under- or overestimate, there will be no systematic pattern of under- or overestimation in our data as the former will cancel out the latter. Constant error occurs where there is some amount of error for every case. When this is the case, values of any measure are systemetically overestimated or underestimated. For instance, people tend to overestimate their driving skills: significantly more than 50% of drivers believe their driving skills are better than average, which of course cannot be true! When such patterns of bias occur in the data, our measures are affected because errors do not cancel each other out. Correlated error occurs when the measurement error correlates with a characteristic that varies across the observations of our data. For instance, overweight people tend to underestimate their weight, whereas underweight people tend to overestimate it (Rowland 1990). This is subtly distinct from random error: even if at the aggregate the amount of overestimated weights is the same as the amount of underestimated weights, the underlying pattern of weight biased measurements can affect the conclusions of a study as it might generate alternative explanations related to weight differences. It is one of the main goals of any measure to minimize such errors. To achieve this, the researcher should pay careful attention to indicator quality, socially desirable responses and other forms of deliberate (mis)representation by respondents. Despite the fact it is often difficult to identify when such errors actually occur, researchers should pay a fair amount of attention trying to minimize them. 1.11 The role of variables: predictors and outcomes I’ve got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you. Remember, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. Normally, when we do some research we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the other variables. It’s important to keep the two roles “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being explained” distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. Firstly, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since it’s going to happen over and over again. Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable \\(Y\\), and denote the variables “doing the explaining” as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), etc. Now, when we doing an analysis, we have different names for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), since they play different roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV). The IV is the variable that you use to do the explaining (i.e., \\(X\\)) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., \\(Y\\)). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) then we can say that \\(Y\\) depends on \\(X\\), and if we have designed our study “properly” then \\(X\\) isn’t dependent on anything else. However, some people have suggested these names are horrible: they’re hard to remember and they can be misleading, because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of everything else” and (b) if there’s no relationship, then the DV doesn’t actually depend on the IV. There are a number of alternatives that some people find more appealing. For example, in an experiment the IV refers to the manipulation, and the DV refers to the measurement. So, we could use manipulated variable (independent variable) and measured variable (dependent variable). Table 1.2: The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analysing a data set. role of the variable classical name modern name to be explained dependent variable (DV) measurement to do the explaining independent variable (IV) manipulation We could also use predictors and outcomes. The idea here is that what you’re trying to do is use \\(X\\) (the predictors) to make guesses about \\(Y\\) (the outcomes). This is summarized in the table: Table 1.3: The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analysing a data set. role of the variable classical name modern name to be explained dependent variable (DV) outcome to do the explaining independent variable (IV) predictor 1.12 That’s it for this week That’s it for the readings of the first week.

Tukey This chapter is about descriptive statistics. These are tools for describing data. Some things to keep in mind as we go along are: There are lots of different ways to describe data There is more than one “correct” way, and you get to choose the most “useful” way for the data that you are describing It is possible to invent new ways of describing data Describing data is necessary because there is usually too much of it, so it doesn’t make any sense by itself. Before we start with describing data, we need to introduce you to the concept of measurement scales. 2.1 Scales of measurement Remember last week when we talked about measurement? To reiterate: the outcome of a measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it’s very useful to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what’s known as scales of measurement. 2.1.1 Nominal scale A nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities: for these kinds of variables it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is ``bigger’ or “better” than any other one, and it absolutely doesn’t make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is “eye colour”. Eyes can be blue, green and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any “better” than any other one. As a result, it would feel really weird to talk about an “average eye colour”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better or worse than female, neither does it make sense to try to talk about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That’s it. Let’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including: “train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”, etc. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when I ask 100 people how they got to work today, and I get this: Transportation Number of people (1) Train 12 (2) Bus 30 (3) Car 48 (4) Bicycle 10 So, what’s the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isn’t one. It’s a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but that’s about all. Similarly, notice that the order in which I list the options isn’t very interesting. I could have chosen to display the data like this and nothing really changes. Transportation Number of people (3) Car 48 (1) Train 12 (4) Bicycle 10 (2) Bus 30 2.1.2 Ordinal scale Ordinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. The usual example given of an ordinal variable is “finishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don’t know how much faster. As a consequence we know that 1st \\(&gt;\\) 2nd, and we know that 2nd \\(&gt;\\) 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd. A more interesting example could be as follows. Suppose I’m interested in people’s attitudes to climate change, and I ask them to pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs: Temperatures are rising, because of human activity Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are not rising Notice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering, in terms of “the extent to which they agree with the current science”. Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a reasonable match, statement 3 isn’t a very good match, and statement 4 is in strong opposition to the science. So, in terms of the thing I’m interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), I can order the items as \\(1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4\\). Since this ordering exists, it would be very weird to list the options like this… Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans Temperatures are rising, because of human activity Temperatures are not rising Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why …because it seems to violate the natural “structure” to the question. So, let’s suppose I asked 100 people these questions, and got the following answers: Response Number (1) Temperatures are rising, because of human activity 51 (2) Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why 20 (3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans 10 (4) Temperatures are not rising 19 When analysing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together, and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And it’s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said…what? There’s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all. That said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we can’t do is average them. For instance, in my simple example here, the “average” response to the question is 1.97. If you can tell me what that means, I’d love to know. Because that sounds like gibberish to me! 2.1.3 Interval scale In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn’t have a “natural” zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees celsius. For instance, if it was 15\\(^\\circ\\) yesterday and 18\\(^\\circ\\) today, then the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference is exactly the same as the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between \\(7^\\circ\\) and \\(10^\\circ\\). In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables. However, notice that the \\(0^\\circ\\) does not mean “no temperature at all”: it actually means “the temperature at which water freezes”, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that \\(20^\\circ\\) is twice as hot as \\(10^\\circ\\), just as it is weird and meaningless to try to claim that \\(20^\\circ\\) is negative two times as hot as \\(-10^\\circ\\). Let’s look at a different example. Suppose I’m interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. Obviously, I’m going to want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started “1.0024 times later” than the first one. That doesn’t make any sense at all. 2.1.4 Ratio scale The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. A good example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks it’s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take \\(3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8\\) seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took \\(3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35\\) times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is that, for a ratio scale variable such as RT, “zero seconds” really does mean “no time at all”. 2.1.5 Continuous versus discrete variables There’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows: A continuous variable is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between. A discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable, it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle. These definitions probably seem a bit abstract, but they’re pretty simple once you see some examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then it’s possible for Cameron’s response time to lie in between, by taking 3.0 seconds. And of course it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones, we say that RT is continuous. Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in between” trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be “partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. The following table summarizes the relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. I’m trying to hammer this point home, because (a) some textbooks get this wrong, and (b) people very often say things like “discrete variable” when they mean “nominal scale variable”. It’s very unfortunate. Table 2.1: The relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. continuous discrete nominal \\(\\checkmark\\) ordinal \\(\\checkmark\\) interval \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) ratio \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) 2.1.6 Some complexities Okay, I know you’re going to be shocked to hear this, but …the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat categories, so you need to be kind of careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn’t work like that: they’re guidelines, intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more. So let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is the bread and butter tool of all survey design. You yourself have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you’ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this: Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that “all pirates are freaking awesome” … and then the options presented to the participant are these: (1) Strongly disagree (2) Disagree (3) Neither agree nor disagree (4) Agree (5) Strongly agree This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it’s not necessary that all items be explicitly described. This is a perfectly good example of a 5-point Likert scale too: (1) Strongly disagree (2) (3) (4) (5) Strongly agree Likert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of variable are they? They’re obviously discrete, since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and they’re not ratio scale either, since there’s no natural zero. But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t really prove that the difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the difference between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life it’s pretty obvious that they’re not the same at all. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as if it were interval scale. It’s not interval scale, but in practice it’s close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale. 2.2 This is what too many numbers looks like What that out of the way, we can start looking at some actual measurements. Let’s say you want to know how happy people are. So, you ask 500 people on the street how happy they are. You let them pick any number they want from negative infinity to positive infinity and record all the numbers in a continuous interval variable. We could look at the numbers and see if that helps determine anything about how happy people are.

That is why we need ways to describe the data in a more manageable fashion. The complete description of the data is the data itself. Descriptive statistics and other tools for describing data go one step further to summarize aspects of the data. Summaries are a way to compress the important bits of a thing down to a useful and manageable tidbit. It’s like telling your friends why they should watch a movie: you don’t replay the entire movie for them, instead you tell them the general highlights. Summarizing the data is just like a movie preview, only for data. 2.3 Describing data using graphs So, we tried one way of looking at the numbers (just printing all of them in a large table) which wasn’t particularly useful. Let’s look at the numbers using graphs. 2.3.1 Scatterplot Let’s turn all of the numbers into dots, then show them in a graph. This type of graph is called a scatterplot. Note, when we do this, we have not yet summarized anything about the data. Instead, we just look at all of the data in a visual format, rather than looking at the numbers themselves. plot(happiness,ylim=c(-1500,1500),las=1) Figure 2.1: Pretend happiness ratings from 500 people Figure 2.1 shows 500 measurements of happiness. The graph has two axes. The horizontal x-axis, going from left to right is labeled “Index”. The vertical y-axis, going up and down, is labeled “happiness”. Each dot represents one measurement of every person’s happiness from our pretend study. Before we talk about what we can see about the data, it is worth mentioning that the way you plot the data will make some things easier to see and some things harder to see. So, what can we now see about the data? Firstly, there are lots of dots everywhere. It looks like there are 500 of them because the index on the x-axis goes to 500. It looks like some dots go as high as -1500 and as low as -1500. It looks like there are more dots in the middle-ish area of the plot, sort of spread around 0. The dots are kind of all over the place, so different people have different levels of happiness, which is not so surprising. But we could now also start to answer questions about the data. Are there any trends? Are more people happy than unhappy, or vice-versa? Take home message: we can visualize our variables by putting them in a plot, which is easier and more helpful than looking at the raw numbers. 2.3.2 Histogram Making a histogram will be our first act of officially summarizing the data. We will no longer look at the individual bits of data, instead we will see how the numbers group together. Let’s look at a histogram of the happiness data, and then explain it. hist(happiness,breaks=6,ylim=c(0,200), xlim=(c(-1500,1500))) Figure 2.2: A histogram of the happiness ratings The dots have disappeared and instead we have some bars. Each bar is a summary of the dots, representing the number of dots (frequency count) inside a particular range of happiness, also called bins. For example, how many people gave a happiness rating between 0 and 500? The fourth bar, the one between 0 and 500 on the x-axis, tells you how many. The height is shown on the y-axis, which provides a frequency count (the number of dots or data points). It looks like around 180 people said their happiness was between 0-500. More generally, we see there are 6 bins on the x-axis. We have divided the data into bins of 500. Bin #1 goes from -1500 to -1000, bin #2 goes from -1000 to -500, and so on until the last bin. To make the histogram, we just count up the number of data points falling inside each bin, then plot those frequency counts as a function of the bins. Voila, a histogram. What does the histogram help us see about the data? First, we can see the shape of data. The shape of the histogram refers to how it goes up and down. The shape tells us where the data is. For example, when the bars are low we know there isn’t much data there. When the bars are high, we know there is more data there. So, where is most of the data? It looks like it’s mostly in the middle two bins, between -500 and 500. We can also see the range of the data. This tells us the minimums and the maximums of the data. Most of the data is between -1500 and +1500, so no infinite sadness or infinite happiness in our data-set. When you make a histogram you get to choose how wide each bar will be. For example, below are four different histograms of the very same happiness data. What changes is the width of the bins. par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2)) g1 &lt;- hist(happiness, breaks = 6, ylim = c(0, 200), xlim = (c(-1500, 1500))) g2 &lt;- hist(happiness, breaks = 12, ylim = c(0, 100), xlim = (c(-1500, 1500))) g3 &lt;- hist(happiness, breaks = 24, ylim = c(0, 50), xlim = (c(-1500, 1500))) g4 &lt;- hist(happiness, breaks = 48, ylim = c(0, 25), xlim = (c(-1500, 1500))) Figure 2.3: Four histograms of the same data using different bin widths All of the histograms have roughly the same overall shape: From left to right, the bars start off small, then go up, then get small again. In other words, as the numbers get closer to zero, they start to occur more frequently. We see this general trend across all the histograms. But, some aspects of the trend fall apart when the bars get really narrow. For example, although the bars generally get taller when moving from -1000 to 0, there are some exceptions and the bars seem to fluctuate a little bit. When the bars are wider, there are less exceptions to the general trend. How wide or narrow should your histogram be? It’s a Goldilocks question. Make it just right for your data. 2.3.3 Other graphs There are many other graphs to describe your data in addition to scatterplots and histograms, but they will be introduced to you as we continue this course. For now it’s important to know that your data can be visualized using a graph and different types of graphs can show you different things about your data. 2.4 Describing data using numbers Let’s introduce three important terms that we will use a lot in descriptive statistics: distribution, central tendency, and variance. These terms are similar to their everyday meanings (although I suspect most people don’t say central tendency very often). Distribution. “To distribute” is to spread something. Notice, the data in the histogram is distributed, or spread across the bins. We can also talk about a distribution as a noun. The histogram is a distribution of the frequency counts across the bins. Distributions are very, very, very, very, very important. They can have many different shapes. They can describe data, like in the histogram above. And as we will learn in later chapters, distributions can also produce data. Many times we will be asking questions about where our data came from, and this usually means asking what kind of distribution could have created our data (more on that later). Central tendency is all about sameness: What is common about some numbers? For example, is there anything similar about all of the numbers in the histogram? Yes, we can say that most of them are near 0. There is a tendency for most of the numbers to be centered near 0. Notice we are being cautious about our generalization about the numbers. We are not saying they are all 0. We are saying there is a tendency for many of them to be near zero. There are lots of ways to talk about the central tendency of some numbers. There can even be more than one kind of tendency. For example, if lots of the numbers were around -1000, and a similar large amount of numbers were grouped around 1000, we could say there was two tendencies. Variance is all about “differentness”. The variance in the numbers refers to how the numbers are different. There are many ways to summarize the amount of variance in the numbers, and we will discuss these very soon. 2.5 Measures of central tendency (sameness) We’ve seen that we can get a sense of data by plotting dots in a graph and by making a histogram. These tools show us what the numbers look like, approximately how big and small they are, and how similar and different they are from another. It is good to get a feeling about the numbers in this way. But, these visual sensitudes are not very precise. In addition to summarizing numbers with graphs, we can summarize numbers using numbers. Measures of central tendency have one important summary goal: to reduce a pile of numbers to a single number that we can look at. We already know that looking at thousands of numbers is hopeless. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just look at one number instead? It turns out there are lots of ways to do this. 2.5.1 Mode The mode is the most frequently occurring number in your measurement. That is it. How do you find it? You have to count the number of times each number appears in your measure, then whichever one occurs the most, is the mode. Example: 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 The mode of the above set is 1, which occurs three times. Every other number only occurs once. OK fine. What happens here: Example: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 Hmm, now 1 and 2 both occur three times each. What do we do? We say there are two modes, 1 and 2, and call the distribution of numbers bimodal. Why is the mode a measure of central tendency? Well, when we ask, “what are my numbers like”, we can say, “most of the number are, like a 1 (or whatever the mode is)”. Is the mode a good measure of central tendency? That depends on your numbers. For example, consider these numbers 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Here, the mode is 1 again, because there are two 1s and all of the other numbers occur once. But, most numbers are not 1s, so you can argue whether the mode is a good summary of the set of numbers in this case. “Argh, so should I or should I not use the mode? I thought this class was supposed to tell me what to do?”. There is no telling you what to do. Every time you use a tool in statistics you have to think about what you are doing and justify if and why what you are doing makes sense. Sorry. 2.5.2 Median The median is the exact middle of the data. After all, we are asking about central tendency, so why not go to the center of the data and see where it lies. Let’s have a look at the following numbers: 1 5 4 3 6 7 9 Umm, OK. So, three is in the middle and therefore the median? That seems kind of arbitrary and it is. Before we compute the median, we need to order the numbers from smallest to largest. 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 Now, 5 is in the middle. There are three numbers to the left of 5, and three numbers to the right. What happens when there aren’t an even number of numbers? Then the middle will be missing right? Let’s see: 1 2 3 4 5 6 There is no number between 3 and 4 in the data, the middle is empty. In this case, we compute the median by figuring out the number in between 3 and 4. So, the median would be 3.5. Is the median a good measure of central tendency? Sure, it is often very useful. One property of the median is that it stays in the middle even when some of the other numbers get really weird. For example, consider these numbers: 1 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 6 7 7 1000 Most of these numbers are smallish, but the 1000 is a big weird number, very different from the rest. The median is still 5, because it is in the middle of these ordered numbers. We can also see that five is pretty similar to most of the numbers (except for 1000). So, the median does a pretty good job of representing most of the numbers in the set, and it does so even if one or two of the numbers are very different from the others. Finally, outlier is a term will we use to describe numbers that appear in data that are very different from the rest. 1000 is an outlier, because it lies way out there on the number line compared to the other numbers. What to do with outliers is another topic we discuss sometimes throughout this course. 2.5.3 Mean Have you noticed this is a textbook about statistics that hasn’t used a formula yet? That is about to change, but for those of you with formula anxiety, don’t worry, we will do our best to explain them. The mean is also called the average. And, we’re guessing you might already now what the average of a bunch of numbers is. It’s the sum of the numbers, divided by the number of numbers right? We express that idea in a formula just like this: \\(\\text{Mean} = \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{N}\\) The \\(\\sum\\) symbol is called sigma, and it stands for the operation of summing. The little “i” on the bottom, and the little “n” on the top refers to all of the numbers in the set, from the first number “i” to the last number “n”. The \\(x_{i}\\) refers to individual numbers in the set. We sum up all of the numbers, then divide the sum by \\(N\\), which is the total number of numbers. Sometimes you will see \\(\\bar{X}\\) (say: ex-bar) to refer to the mean of a set of numbers. In plain English, the formula looks like: \\(\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of my numbers}}{\\text{Count of my numbers}}\\) Let’s compute the mean for these five numbers: 3 7 9 2 6 Add em up: 3+7+9+2+6 = 27 Count em up: \\(i_{1}\\) = 3, \\(i_{2}\\) = 7, \\(i_{3}\\) = 9, \\(i_{4}\\) = 2, \\(i_{5}\\) = 6; N=5, because \\(i\\) went from 1 to 5 Divide em: mean = 27 / 5 = 5.4 Or, to put the numbers in the formula, it looks like this: \\(\\text{Mean} = \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{N} = \\frac{3+7+9+2+6}{5} = \\frac{27}{5} = 5.4\\) Is the mean a good measure of central tendency? By now, you can guess: it depends. 2.5.4 What does the mean mean? It is not enough to know the formula for the mean, or to be able to use the formula to compute a mean for a set of numbers. We believe in your ability to add and divide numbers. What you really need to know is what the mean really “means”. This requires that you know what the mean does, and not just how to do it. Puzzled? Let’s explain. Let’s think about the following questions: What happens when you divide a sum of numbers by the number of numbers? What are the consequences of doing this? What is the formula doing? What kind of properties does the result give us? Of course, the key word here is divide. We literally carve the number up top in the numerator into pieces. How many times do we split the top number? That depends on the bottom number in the denominator. Watch: \\(\\frac{12}{3} = 4\\) So, we know the answer is 4. But, what is really going on here is that we are slicing and dicing up 12 into three parts. It turns out the size of those three parts is 4. So, now we are thinking of 12 as three different pieces \\(12 = 4 + 4 + 4\\). I know this will be obvious, but what kind of properties do our pieces have? Well, obviously they are all fours. The pieces are all the same size. They are all equal. So, division equalizes the numerator by the denominator… “Umm, I think I learned this in elementary school, what does this have to do with the mean?”. The number on top of the formula for the mean is just another numerator being divided by a denominator. In this case, the numerator is a sum of all the values in your data. What if it was the sum of all of the 500 happiness ratings? The sum of all of them would just be a single number adding up all the different ratings. If we split the sum up into equal parts representing one part for each person’s happiness we would get 500 identical and equal numbers for each person. It would be like taking all of the happiness in the world, then dividing it up equally, then to be fair, giving back the same equal amount of happiness to everyone in the world. This would make some people more happy than they were before, and some people less happy right. Of course, that’s because it would be equalizing the distribution of happiness for everybody. This process of equalization by dividing something into equal parts is what the mean does. See, it’s more than just a formula. It’s an idea. This is just the beginning of thinking about these kinds of ideas. We will come back to this idea about the mean, and other ideas, in later chapters. Take home: the mean is the one and only number that can take the place of every number in the data, such that when you add up all the equal parts, you get back the original sum of the data. 2.5.5 All together now Just to remind ourselves of the mode, median, and mean, take a look at the next histogram of our happiness data set. We have overlaid the location of the mode (blue), median (green), and mean (red). The location of the mode, median and mean are pretty similar. Figure 2.4: A histogram of happiness with the mode (blue), median (green), and mean (red) But that’s not always the case. Suppose I collect data on the length of phone calls to an IT call center. Most phone calls are dealt with quickly and are relatively short, but there are some people with difficult questions that require much more assistance than other callers. For this data set, the three measures of central tendency all give different answers. The mean has the largest value, because it is influenced by large numbers (the few very long phone calls), even if they occur rarely. The median is less sensitive to large numbers that occur infrequently, so the value of the median is smaller. The mode is not affected by the infrequent large numbers at all. Figure 2.5: A histogram of phone call length with the mode (blue), median (green), and mean (red) 2.6 Measures of variation (differentness) Writing a book report in high school probably meant you were comparing and contrasting things. When you summarize data, you do the same thing. Measures of central tendency give us something like comparing does, they tell us about what is the same. Measures of variation give us something like contrasting does, they tell us about what is different. First, we note that whenever you see a bunch of numbers that aren’t the same, you already know there are some differences. This means the numbers vary, and there is variation in the size of the numbers. 2.6.1 The range Consider these 10 numbers, that I already ordered from smallest to largest for you: 1 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 24 The numbers have variation, because they are not all the same. We can use the range to describe the width of the variation. The range refers to the minimum (smallest value) and maximum (largest value) in the set. So, the range would be 1 and 24. The range is a good way to quickly summarize the boundaries of your data in just two numbers. By computing the range we know that none of the data is larger or smaller than the range. And, it can alert you to outliers. For example, if you are expecting your numbers to be between 1 and 7, but you find the range is 1 - 3405, then you know you have at least one big number that shouldn’t be there, and you can try to figure out why that occurred (and potentially remove it and other outliers). 2.6.2 Difference scores It would be nice to summarize the amount of differentness in the data. Here’s why: if you thought that raw data (lots of numbers) is too big to look at, then you will be frightened to contemplate how many differences there are to look at. For example, these 10 numbers are easy to look at: 1 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 24 But, what about the difference between the numbers, what do those look like? We can compute the difference scores between each number, then put them in a matrix like the one below: 1 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 24 1 0 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 23 3 -2 0 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 21 4 -3 -1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 20 5 -4 -2 -1 0 0 1 2 3 4 19 5 -4 -2 -1 0 0 1 2 3 4 19 6 -5 -3 -2 -1 -1 0 1 2 3 18 7 -6 -4 -3 -2 -2 -1 0 1 2 17 8 -7 -5 -4 -3 -3 -2 -1 0 1 16 9 -8 -6 -5 -4 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 15 24 -23 -21 -20 -19 -19 -18 -17 -16 -15 0 We are looking at all of the possible differences between each number and every other number. So, in the top left, the difference between 1 and itself is 0. One column over to the right, the difference between 3 and 1 (3-1) is 2, etc. As you can see, this is a 10x10 matrix, which means there are 100 differences to look at. Not too bad, but if we had 500 numbers, then we would have 500*500 = 250,000 differences to look at (go for it if you like looking at that sort of thing). For a moment, let’s think about what this matrix look like if all of the 10 numbers in our data were the same number? It should look like a bunch of 0s right? In that case, we could easily see that the numbers have no variation. But, when the numbers are different, it’s not so easy to see what the variation of our data set is. However, we could ask something like, what is the average difference that we have? For example, we could take all of our differences and compute the mean difference. What do you think would happen if we did that? Let’s try it out on these three numbers: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 0 1 2 2 -1 0 1 3 -2 -1 0 Let’s compute the mean: \\(\\text{mean of difference scores} = \\frac{0+1+2-1+0+1-2-1+0}{9} = \\frac{0}{9} = 0\\) Uh oh, we get zero for the mean of the difference scores. This will always happen whenever you take the mean of the difference scores. We can see that there are some differences between the numbers, so using 0 as the summary value for the variation in the numbers doesn’t make much sense. Furthermore, you might also notice that the matrices of difference scores are redundant. The diagonal is always zero, and numbers on one side of the diagonal are the same as the numbers on the other side, except their signs are reversed. These are problems that can be solved by computing the variance and the standard deviation. For now, the standard deviation is a just a trick that we use to avoid getting a zero. But, later we will see it has properties that are important for other reasons. 2.6.3 The variance Variability, variation, variance, vary, variable, varying, variety. Confused yet? Before we describe the variance, we want to you be OK with how this word is used. First, don’t forget the big picture. We know that variability and variation refers to the big idea of differences between numbers. We can even use the word variance in the same way. When numbers are different, they have variance. The word variance also refers to a specific summary statistic: the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. Hold on what? In plain English: the variance is the sum of the squared difference scores, where the difference scores are computed between each number in the data set and the mean. Let’s see the formula in English first5: \\(\\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of squared difference scores}}{\\text{Number of Scores}}\\) 2.6.3.1 Deviations from the mean We got a little bit complicated before when we computed the difference scores between all of the numbers in the data. Let’s do it again, but in a more manageable way. This time, we calculate the difference between each score and the mean. The idea here is: We figure out how similar our scores are by computing the mean Then we figure out how different our scores are from the mean This could tell us something about whether our scores are really all very close to the mean (which could help us know if the mean is good representative number of the data), and something about how much differences there are in the numbers. Take a look at this table: scores values mean difference_from_mean 1 1 4.5 -3.5 2 6 4.5 1.5 3 4 4.5 -0.5 4 2 4.5 -2.5 5 6 4.5 1.5 6 8 4.5 3.5 Sums 27 27 0 Means 4.5 4.5 0 The first column shows we have 6 scores in the data set, and the value columns shows each individual score. The sum of the values and the mean are presented on the last two rows. The sum and the mean were obtained by: \\(\\frac{1+6+4+2+6+8}{6} = \\frac{27}{6} = 4.5\\). The third column mean, appears a bit silly. We are just listing the mean once for every score. If you think back to our discussion about the meaning of the mean, then you will remember that it equally distributes the total sum across each data point. We can see that here, if we treat each score as the mean, then every score is a 4.5. We can also see that adding up all of the means for each score gives us back 27, which is the sum of the original values. Also, we see that if we find the mean of the mean scores, we get back the mean (4.5 again). All of the action is occurring in the fourth column, difference_from_mean. Here, we are showing the difference scores from the mean, using \\(X_{i}-\\bar{X}\\). In other words, we subtracted the mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) from each individual score (\\(X_{i}\\)). So, the first score, 1, is -3.5 from the mean, the second score, 6, is +1.5 from the mean, and so on. Now, we can look at our original scores and we can look at their differences from the mean. Notice, we don’t have a matrix of raw difference scores, so it is much easier to look at. But, we still have a problem: We can see that there are non-zero values in the difference scores, so we know there are a differences in the data. But, when we add them all up, we still get zero, which makes it seem like there are a total of zero differences in the data… 2.6.3.2 The squared deviations Some devious someone divined a solution to the fact that differences scores from the mean always add to zero. The devious solution is to square the numbers. Squaring numbers converts all the negative numbers to positive numbers. For example, \\(2^2 = 4\\), and \\(-2^2 = 4\\). We use the term squared deviations to refer to differences scores that have been squared. Deviations are things that move away from something. The difference scores move away from the mean, so we also call them deviations. Let’s look at our table again, but add the squared deviations. scores values mean difference_from_mean squared_deviations 1 1 4.5 -3.5 12.25 2 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 3 4 4.5 -0.5 0.25 4 2 4.5 -2.5 6.25 5 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 6 8 4.5 3.5 12.25 Sums 27 27 0 35.5 Means 4.5 4.5 0 5.91666666666667 OK, now we have a new column called squared_deviations. These are just the difference scores squared. So, \\(-3.5^2 = 12.25\\), etc. You can confirm this for yourself with your calculator. Now that all of the squared deviations are positive, we can add them up. When we do this we create something very special called the sum of squares (SS), also known as the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. 2.6.3.3 Finally, the variance Guess what, we already computed the variance. It already happened, and maybe you didn’t notice. First, see if you can remember what we are trying to do here. Take a pause, and see if you can tell yourself what problem we are trying solve. pause Without further ado, we are trying to get a summary of the differences in our data. There are just as many difference scores from the mean as there are data points, which can be a lot, so it would be nice to have a single number to look at, something like a mean, that would tell us about the average differences in the data. If you look at the table, you can see we already computed the mean of the squared deviations. First, we found the sum of squares (SS), then below that we calculated the mean of the sum of squares = 5.916 repeating. This is the variance. The variance is the mean of the sum of the squared deviations: \\(\\text{variance} = \\frac{SS}{N}\\), where SS is the sum of the squared deviations, and N is the number of observations. OK, now what. What do I do with the variance? What does this number mean? Good question. The variance is often an unhelpful number to look at, because it is not in the same scale as the original data. This is because we squared the difference scores before taking the mean. Squaring produces large numbers. For example, we see a 12.25 in there. That’s a big difference, bigger than any difference between any two original values. How can we bring the numbers back down to their original unsquared size? That’s easy: we can always unsquare anything by taking the square root. So, let’s do that to 5.916: \\(\\sqrt{5.916} =\\) 2.4322829. 2.6.4 The standard deviation Oops, we did it again. We already computed the standard deviation, and we didn’t tell you. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance…At least, it is right now, until we complicate matters for you in later chapters. Here is the formula for the standard deviation: \\(\\text{standard deviation} = \\sqrt{\\text{variance}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS}{N}}\\). We could also expand this to say: \\(\\text{standard deviation} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i}^{n}({x_{i}-\\bar{x})^2}}{N}}\\) Don’t let those big square root signs put you off. You know what they are doing there: they are just bringing our measure of the variance back down to the original size of the data. Let’s look at our table again: scores values mean difference_from_mean squared_deviations 1 1 4.5 -3.5 12.25 2 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 3 4 4.5 -0.5 0.25 4 2 4.5 -2.5 6.25 5 6 4.5 1.5 2.25 6 8 4.5 3.5 12.25 Sums 27 27 0 35.5 Means 4.5 4.5 0 5.91666666666667 We measured the standard deviation as 2.4322829. Notice this number fits right in the with differences scores from the mean. All of the scores are kind of in and around + or - 2.4322829. Whereas, if we looked at the variance, 5.916 is just too big, it doesn’t summarize the actual differences very well. What does all this mean? Well, if someone told they had some number with a mean of 4.5 (like the values in our table), and a standard deviation of 2.4322829, you would get a pretty good summary of the numbers. You would know that many of the numbers are around 4.5, and you would know that not all of the numbers are 4.5. You would know that the numbers spread around 4.5. You also know that the spread isn’t super huge, it’s only + or - 2.4322829 on average. That’s a good starting point for describing numbers. If you had loads of numbers, you could reduce them down to the mean and the standard deviation, and still be pretty well off in terms of getting a sense of those numbers. 2.6.5 Closing thoughts on measures of variation We spent many paragraphs talking about variation in numbers, and how to use the variance and standard deviation to summarize the average differences between numbers in a data set. The basic process was to 1) calculate some measure of the differences, then 2) average the differences to create a summary. We found that we couldn’t average the raw difference scores, because we would always get a zero. So, we squared the differences from the mean, then averaged the squared differences differences. Finally, we square rooted our measure to bring the summary back down to the scale of the original numbers. Perhaps you were thinking that the problem of summing difference scores (so that they don’t equal zero), can be solved in more than one way. How about just taking the absolute value of the difference scores?6 Many things are possible. The important aspect to any of this is to have a reason for what you are doing, and to choose a method that works for the data-analysis problem you are trying to solve. Note also, we bring up this general discussion because we want you to understand that statistics is a creative exercise. We invent things when we need them, and we use things that have already been invented when they work for the problem at hand. 2.7 Remember to look at your data Using numbers to describe data is great and we will use it a lot during this course, but you may suspect these descriptive statistics also have some short-comings. They are compressed summaries of large piles of numbers and will almost always be unable to represent all of the numbers fairly. There are also different kinds of descriptive statistics that you could use and it sometimes not clear which one’s you should use. Perhaps the most important thing you can do when describing data is to use both graphs and numbers. This can help you see whether or not your descriptive statistics are doing a good job of representing the data. 2.7.1 Anscombe’s Quartet To hit this point home, and to get you thinking about the issues we discuss in the next chapter, check out the following. It’s called Anscombe’s Quartet, because these interesting graphs and numbers were produced by Anscombe (1973). You are looking at several scatterplots of different measurements and each of the plots look very different, right? It is maybe surprising to learn that the descriptive statistics for the numbers in these graphs are (almost) exactly the same. In the table below I present the mean and variance for the x-values in each graph, and the mean and the variance for the y-values in each graph. quartet mean_x var_x mean_y var_y 1 9 11 7.500909 4.127269 2 9 11 7.500909 4.127629 3 9 11 7.500000 4.122620 4 9 11 7.500909 4.123249 Anscombe put these special numbers together to illustrate the point of visualizing your numbers. If you only look at your descriptive statistics, you don’t know what patterns in the data they are hiding. If you look at your descriptive statistics in combination with a graph, then you can get a better understanding. 2.7.2 Datasaurus Dozen If you thought that Anscombe’s quartet was neat, you should take a look at the Datasaurus Dozen (Matejka and Fitzmaurice 2017). The scatterplots show many different patterns, including dinosaurs! What’s amazing is that all of the scatterplots have very nearly the same descriptive statistics. Just another reminder to look at your data, it might look like a dinosaur! Figure 2.6: Datasaurus: different scatterplots with nearly identical descriptive statistics 2.8 That’s it for this week That’s it for the readings of the second week. During the lab you will learn about graphing and generating descriptive statistics in R.

It was too much too look at and it didn’t make sense. So, we talked about how to look at the data using graphs and we talked about how to summarize lots of numbers using their central tendencies (sameness) and variability (differentness). If you are looking for a big theme to think about while you take this course, the theme is: how do we ask and answer questions using data? For every section in this book, you should be connecting your inner monologue to this question, and asking yourself: how does what I am learning help me answer questions about data? We know it is easy to forget this stuff when we dive into the details, but we will try to throw you a rope to help you out along the way… We started last week with some fake data on human happiness, remember? We imagined that we asked a bunch of people to tell us how happy they were, then we looked at the numbers they gave us. Let’s continue with this imaginary thought experiment. If you ask people to use a number to describe how happy they are, you get a bunch of numbers. What kind of questions can you ask about those numbers? Well, you can look at the numbers and estimate their general properties as we did last week. There are different people, and different people are different amounts of happy. You’ve probably met some of those of really happy people, and really unhappy people, and you yourself probably have some amount of happiness. Before moving on, you should be skeptical of what the numbers might mean. For example, if you force people to give a number between 0-100 to rate their happiness, does this number truly reflect how happy that person is? Can a person know how happy they are? Does the question format bias how they give their answer? Is happiness even a real thing? These are all good questions about the validity of the construct (happiness itself) and the measure (numbers) you are using to quantify it. For now, though, we will side-step those very important questions, and assume that, happiness is a thing, and our measure of happiness measures something about how happy people are. OK, after we have measured some happiness, I bet you can think of some interesting questions. For example: what causes happiness to go up or down? If you knew the causes of happiness you could increase your own happiness; or, help people who are unhappy; or, better appreciate why Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh is unhappy; or, present valid scientific arguments that argue against incorrect claims about what causes happiness. A causal theory and understanding of happiness could be used for all of those things, so how can we get there? 3.1 If something caused something else to change, what would that look like? Before we go around determining the causes of happiness, we should prepare ourselves with some analytical tools so that we could identify what causation looks like. If we don’t prepare ourselves for what we might find, then we won’t know how to interpret our own data. Instead, we need to anticipate what the data could look like. Specifically, we need to know what data would look like when one thing does not cause another thing, and what data would look like when one thing does cause another thing. This chapter does some of this preparation. Fair warning: we will find out some tricky things. For example, we can find patterns that look like one thing is causing another, even when that one thing DOES NOT CAUSE the other thing. Hang in there. 3.1.1 Charlie and the chocolate factory Let’s imagine that a person’s supply of chocolate has a causal influence on their level of happiness. Let’s further imagine that, like Charlie, the more chocolate you have the more happy you will be, and the less chocolate you have, the less happy you will be. Finally, because we suspect happiness is caused by lots of other things in a person’s life, we anticipate that the relationship between chocolate supply and happiness won’t be perfect. What do these assumptions mean for how the data should look? Our first step is to collect some imaginary data from 100 people. We walk around and ask the first 100 people we meet to answer two questions: how much chocolate do you have, and how happy are you. For convenience, both the scales will go from 0 to 100. For the chocolate scale, 0 means no chocolate, 100 means lifetime supply of chocolate. Any other number is somewhere in between. For the happiness scale, 0 means no happiness, 100 means all of the happiness, and in between means some amount in between. Below is how the data was generated in R and in the table you can find the sample data from the first 10 imaginary subjects. # create a vector with 100 subjects subject &lt;- 1:100 # use a uniform distribution to generate pretend happiness and chocolate # variables chocolate &lt;- round(1:100 * runif(100, 0.5, 1)) happiness &lt;- round(1:100 * runif(100, 0.5, 1)) # put all variables in a dataframe df_charlie &lt;- data.frame(subject, chocolate, happiness) # show only the first 10 rows of the main dataframe df_charlie_short &lt;- df_charlie[1:10, ] subject chocolate happiness 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 2 5 4 5 6 5 4 7 4 7 8 6 5 9 5 7 10 10 6 We asked each subject two questions so there are two scores for each subject, one for their chocolate supply, and one for their level of happiness. You might already notice some relationships between amount of chocolate and level of happiness in the table. To make those relationships even more clear, let’s plot all of the data in a graph. When you have two variables worth of data, you can turn the data into a scatterplot where you get to choose which variable goes on which axis. Let’s put chocolate supply on the x-axis, and happiness level on the y-axis. library(ggplot2) ggplot(df_charlie,aes(x=chocolate,y=happiness))+ geom_point()+ theme_classic() Figure 3.1: Imaginary data showing a positive relationship between amount of chocolate and amount happiness What do the dots mean? Each dot has two coordinates, an x-coordinate for chocolate, and a y-coordinate for happiness. The first dot, all the way on the bottom left is the first subject in the table, who had close to 0 chocolate and close to zero happiness. You can look at any dot and draw a straight line down to the x-axis: that will tell you how much chocolate that subject has. When you draw a straight line left to the y-axis for the same dot it will tell you how much happiness that particular subject has. Now that we are looking at the scatterplot, we can clearly see that the dots show a relationship between chocolate supply and happiness. Happiness is lower for people with smaller supplies of chocolate, and higher for people with larger supplies of chocolate. It looks like the more chocolate you have the happier you will be, and vice-versa. This kind of relationship is called a positive relationship or positive correlation. 3.1.2 Positive, negative or no correlation Seeing as we are in the business of imagining data, let’s imagine some more. We’ve already seen what data looks like if larger chocolate supplies increase happiness. What do you imagine the scatterplot would look like if the relationship was reversed, and larger chocolate supplies decreased happiness? Or, what do you imagine the scatter plot would look like if there was no relationship, and the amount of chocolate that you have doesn’t do anything to your happiness? We invite your imagination to look at these graphs: Figure 3.2: Three scatterplots showing negative, positive, and zero correlation The first panel shows a negative correlation. Happiness goes down as chocolate supply increases. Negative correlation occurs when one thing goes up and the other thing goes down; or, when more of X is less of Y, and vice-versa. The second panel shows a positive correlation. Happiness goes up as chocolate as chocolate supply increases. Positive correlation occurs when both things go up together, and go down together: more of X is more of Y, and vice-versa. The third panel shows no correlation. Here, there doesn’t appear to be any obvious relationship between chocolate supply and happiness. The dots are scattered all over the place, the truest of the scatterplots8. Zero correlation occurs when one thing is not related in any way to another things: changes in X do not relate to any changes in Y, and vice-versa. 3.2 Pearson’s \\(r\\) If Beyoncé was a statistician, she might look at these scatterplots and want to “put a number on it”. We think this is a good idea too. We’ve already learned how to create descriptive statistics for a single measure, like chocolate, or happiness (i.e., means, variances, etc.). A descriptive statistic that summarizes the relationship between two measures, all in one number, was invented by Karl Pearson9. Everyone now calls it: “Pearson’s \\(r\\)”. Karl Pearson was a big-wig editor at Biometrika in the 1930s and all around horrible person. He took a hating to another big-wig statistician, Sir Ronald Fisher (who we learn about later, but was also generally a horrible person), and they had some fights about statistics… Seen as the founding fathers of modern statistics, both Pearson and Fisher held deeply racist views and actively contributed to the field of eugenics. You can read more about the troubled history of modern statistics in many, many different places. For now, we will focus about how different statistics work and how to use statistics (for good, hopefully), but it’s important to keep this troubled history in mind. How does Pearson’s \\(r\\) work? Let’s look again at the first 10 subjects in our fake experiment: subject chocolate happiness 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 2 5 4 5 6 5 4 7 4 7 8 6 5 9 5 7 10 10 6 Sums 41 42 Means 4.1 4.2 What could we do to these numbers to produce a single summary value that represents the relationship between the chocolate supply and happiness? 3.2.1 The idea of covariance “Oh please no, don’t use the word variance again”. Yes, we’re doing it, we’re going to use the word variance again, and again, and again, until it starts making sense. Remember: variance tells us something about the differentness of a measure. In this example, we can see that there is variance in chocolate supply across the 10 subjects and that there is variance in happiness across the 10 subjects. In the scatterplot we saw that as happiness increases, chocolate supply increases (a positive relationship). What does this have to do with variance? Well, it means there is a relationship between the variance in chocolate supply, and the variance in happiness levels. In other words: the two measures vary together. When we have two measures that vary together, they are like a happy couple who share their variance. This is what covariance refers to: the idea that the pattern of varying numbers in one measure is shared by the pattern of varying numbers in another measure. Covariance is very, very, very, very important. We suspect that the word covariance is initially confusing, especially if you are not yet fully comfortable with the meaning of variance for a single measure. Nevertheless, we must proceed and use the idea of covariance over and over again to firmly implant it into your statistical mind (we already said, but redundancy works, it’s a thing). Note: A three-legged race can be seen as a metaphor for covariance. Two people tie one leg to each other, then try to walk. It works when they co-vary their legs together (positive relationship). They can also co-vary in an unhelpful way, when one person tries to move forward exactly when the other person tries to move backward. This is still covariance (negative relationship). Funny random walking happens when there is no covariance. This means one person does whatever they want, and so does the other person. There is a lot of variance, but the variance is shared randomly, so it’s just a bunch of legs moving around accomplishing nothing. Note #2: Succesfully playing pattycake occurs when two people coordinate their actions so they have postively shared covariance. 3.2.2 A measure of covariance “OK, so you are saying that covariance is just another word for the association or relationship between two measures. I suppose we could use some way to measure that.” Back to our table…notice anything new? subject chocolate happiness chocolate_X_happiness 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 3 6 4 3 2 6 5 4 5 20 6 5 4 20 7 4 7 28 8 6 5 30 9 5 7 35 10 10 6 60 Sums 41 42 208 Means 4.1 4.2 20.8 We’ve added a new column called “chocolate_X_happiness”, which stands for chocolate scores multiplied by happiness scores. Each row in the new column is the product, or multiplication, of the chocolate and happiness score for that row. Why would we want to do this? Last chapter we took you back to elementary school and had you think about division. Now it’s time to do the same thing with multiplication. One number times another, means taking the first number, and adding it as many times as the second says to do, \\(2*2= 2+2=4\\) \\(2*6= 2+2+2+2+2+2 = 12\\), or \\(6+6=12\\), same thing. You know all that. All we have to think about next are the consequences of multiplying sets of numbers together. For example, what happens when you multiply two small numbers together, compared to multiplying two big numbers together? The first product should be smaller than the second product right? How about things like multiplying a small number by a big number? Those products should be in between, right? The next step is to think about how the products of two measures sum together, depending on how they line up. Let’s look at another table: scores X Y A B XY AB 1 1 1 1 10 1 10 2 2 2 2 9 4 18 3 3 3 3 8 9 24 4 4 4 4 7 16 28 5 5 5 5 6 25 30 6 6 6 6 5 36 30 7 7 7 7 4 49 28 8 8 8 8 3 64 24 9 9 9 9 2 81 18 10 10 10 10 1 100 10 Sums 55 55 55 55 385 220 Means 5.5 5.5 5.5 5.5 38.5 22 Look at the \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) column. The scores for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) perfectly co-vary. When \\(X\\) is 1, \\(Y\\) is 1; when \\(X\\) is 2, \\(Y\\) is 2, etc. They are perfectly aligned. The scores for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) also perfectly co-vary, just in the opposite manner. When \\(A\\) is 1, \\(B\\) is 10; when \\(A\\) is 2, \\(B\\) is 9, etc. \\(B\\) is a reversed copy of \\(A\\). Now, look at the column \\(XY\\). These are the products we get when we multiply the values of \\(X\\) across with the values of Y. Also, look at the column \\(AB\\). These are the products we get when we multiply the values of \\(A\\) across with the values of \\(B\\). So far so good. Next, look at the Sums for the \\(XY\\) and \\(AB\\) columns. They are not the same. The sum of the \\(XY\\) products is 385, and the sum of the \\(AB\\) products is 220. For this specific set of data, the numbers 385 and 220 are very important. They represent the biggest possible sum of products (385), and the smallest possible sum of products (220). There is no way of re-ordering the numbers 1 to 10 for \\(X\\), and the numbers 1 to 10 for \\(Y\\), that would ever produce larger or smaller numbers. Check this out: The above graph shows 1000 computer simulations. I convinced my computer to randomly order the numbers 1 to 10 for \\(X\\), and randomly order the numbers 1 to 10 for \\(Y\\). Then, I multiplied \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and added the products together. I did this 1000 times. The dots show the sum of the products for each simulation. The two red lines show the maximum possible sum (385), and the minimum possible sum (220), for this set of numbers. Notice, how all of the dots are in between the maximum and minimum possible values. “Who cares?” Well, for these numbers, we have found a way to summarize the covariance between two measures. We know that when the sum of the products is 385, we have found a perfect, positive relationship. We also know that when the sum of the products is 220, we have found a perfect negative relationship. What about the numbers in between? What could we conclude about the relationship if we found the sum of the products to be 350? Well, it’s likely going to be positive, because it’s close to 385, which is perfectly positive. If the sum of the products was 240, the relationship is likely going to be negative, because it’s close to the perfectly negative 220. What about no relationship? Well, that’s going to be in the middle between 220 and 385. We have just come up with a data-specific summary measure for the relationship between the numbers 1 to 10 in \\(X\\), and the numbers 1 to 10 in \\(Y\\): it’s the sum of the products. We know the maximum (385) and minimum values (220), so we can now interpret any product sum for this kind of data with respect to that scale. Note: when the relationship between two measures increases in the positive direction, the sum of their products increases to its maximum possible value. This is because the bigger numbers in \\(X\\) will tend to line up with the bigger numbers in \\(Y\\), creating the biggest possible sum of products. When the relationship between two measures increases in the negative direction, the sum of their products decreases to its minimum possible value. This is because the bigger numbers in \\(X\\) will tend to line up with the smaller numbers in \\(Y\\), creating the smallest possible sum of products. When there is no correlation, the big numbers in X will be randomly lined up with the big and small numbers in \\(Y\\), making the sum of the products somewhere in the middle. 3.2.3 Covariance formalized We took some time to see what happens when you multiply sets of numbers together. We found that \\(\\text{big*big = bigger}\\) and \\(\\text{small*small=still small}\\), and \\(\\text{big*small=in the middle}\\). The purpose of this was to give you some conceptual idea of how the covariance between two measures is reflected in the sum of their products. We did something very straightforward. We just multiplied \\(X\\) with \\(Y\\), and looked at how the product sums get big and small, as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) co-vary in different ways. Now, we can get a little bit more formal. In statistics, covariance is not just the straight multiplication of values in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Instead, it’s the multiplication of the deviations in \\(X\\) from the mean of \\(X\\), and the deviation in \\(Y\\) from the mean of \\(Y\\). Remember those difference scores from the mean we talked about last chapter? They’re coming back to haunt you know, but in a good way, like Casper the friendly ghost. Let’s see what this look like in a table: subject chocolate happiness c_d h_d cd_X_hd 1 1 1 -3.1 -3.2 9.92 2 1 2 -3.1 -2.2 6.82 3 2 3 -2.1 -1.2 2.52 4 3 2 -1.1 -2.2 2.42 5 4 5 -0.1 0.8 -0.08 6 5 4 0.9 -0.2 -0.18 7 4 7 -0.1 2.8 -0.28 8 6 5 1.9 0.8 1.52 9 5 7 0.9 2.8 2.52 10 10 6 5.9 1.8 10.62 Sums 41 42 0 0 36 Means 4.1 4.2 0 0 3.58 We have computed the deviations from the mean for the chocolate scores (column c_d), and the deviations from the mean for the happiness scores (column h_d). Then, we multiplied them together (last column). Finally, you can see the mean of the products listed in the bottom right corner of the table, the covariance. The formula for the covariance is: \\(cov(X,Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{X})(y_{i}-\\bar{Y})}{N}\\) These are simply the steps we just took, but in the form of a formula. OK, so now we have a formal single number to calculate the relationship between two variables. This is great, it’s what we’ve been looking for. However, there is still a problem. Remember when we learned how to compute just the plain old variance. We looked at that number, and we didn’t know what to make of it. It was squared, it wasn’t in the same scale as the original data. So, we square rooted the variance to produce the standard deviation, which gave us a more interpretable number in the range of our data. The covariance has a similar problem. When you calculate the covariance as we just did, we don’t know immediately know its scale. Is a 3 big? is a 6 big? is a 100 big? How big or small is this thing? From our prelude discussion on the idea of covariance, we learned the sum of products between two measures ranges between a maximum and minimum value. The same is true of the covariance. For a given set of data, there is a maximum possible positive value for the covariance (which occurs when there is perfect positive relationship). And, there is a minimum possible negative value for the covariance (which occurs when there is a perfect negative relationship). When there is zero co-variation: zeroes. So, at the very least, when we look at a co-variation statistic, we can see what direction it points, positive or negative. But, we don’t know how big or small it is compared to the maximum or minimum possible value, so we don’t know the relative size, which means we can’t say how strong the relationship is. What to do? 3.2.4 \\(r\\) we there yet? Yes, we are here now. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could force our measure of co-variation to be between -1 and +1? -1 would be the minimum possible value for a perfect negative association. +1 would be the maximum possible value for a perfect positive association. 0 would mean no association. Everything in between 0 and -1 would be increasingly large negative associations. Everything between 0 and +1 would be increasingly large positive associations. It would be a fantastic, sensible, easy to interpret system. If only we could force the co-variation number to be between -1 and 1. Fortunately, Pearson’s \\(r\\) does precisely this wonderful thing. Let’s take a look at a formula: \\(r = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_{X}\\sigma_{Y}} = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{SD_{X}SD_{Y}}\\) We see the symbol \\(\\sigma\\) here, that’s more Greek for you. \\(\\sigma\\) is often used as a symbol for the standard deviation (SD). If we read out the formula in English, we see that \\(r\\) is the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), divided by the product of the standard deviation of \\(X\\) and the standard deviation of \\(Y\\). Dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations has the effect of normalizing the covariance into the range -1 to 1. For now, we will call this mathematical magic10. It works, but we don’t have space to tell you why it works right now. Note: it’s worth saying that there are loads of different formulas for computing Pearson’s \\(r\\). You can find them by Googling them. We will probably include more of them here, when we get around to it. However, they all give you the same answer. And, they are all not as pretty as each other. Some of them might even look scary. In other statistics textbook you will often find formulas that are easier to use for calculation purposes. For example, if you only had a pen and paper, you might use one or another formula because it helps you compute the answer faster by hand. To be honest, we are not very interested in teaching you how to plug numbers into formulas. Nowadays you have a computer that you should use for this kind of stuff. So, we are more interested in teaching you what the calculations mean, rather than how to do them. Of course, every week we are showing you how to do the calculations in the labs using computers. Does Pearson’s \\(r\\) really stay between -1 and 1 no matter what? It’s true, take a look at the following simulation. Here I randomly ordered the numbers 1 to 10 for an \\(X\\) measure, and did the same for a \\(Y\\) measure. Then, I computed Pearson’s \\(r\\), and repeated this process 1000 times. As you can see all of the dots are between -1 and 1. Neat huh. Figure 3.3: A simulation of 1000 correlations. Each dot represents the \\(r\\)-value for the correlation between an \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) variable that each contain the numbers 1 to 10 in random orders. 3.3 Examples of \\(r\\) with data During the labs you will be shown how to compute correlations in real datasets using software. To give you a brief preview, let’s look at some data from the world happiness report (2018). This report measured various attitudes across people from different countries over the time period 2006-2017. For example, one question asked about how much freedom people thought they had to make life choices. Another question asked how confident people were in their national government. Here is a scatterplot showing the relationship between these two measures and how to generate that plot in R. Each dot represents a different country in 2017. library(data.table) library(dplyr) # import the data whr_data &lt;- fread(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomashulst/quantrma/master/data/WHR2018.csv&#39;) # select the relevant variables and filter missing data (NA) smaller_df &lt;- whr_data %&gt;% dplyr::select(country, `Freedom to make life choices`, `Confidence in national government`, `year`) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(`year` == 2017) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(!is.na(`Freedom to make life choices`), !is.na(`Confidence in national government`)) # plot the data with best fit line ggplot(smaller_df, aes(x=`Freedom to make life choices`, y=`Confidence in national government`))+ geom_point(alpha=.5)+ geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)+ theme_classic() Figure 3.4: Relationship between freedom to make life choices and confidence in national government. Data for the year 2017 from the world happiness report for 2018. We put a blue line on the scatterplot to visualize the positive relationship. It appears that as “freedom to make life choices goes up”, so to does confidence in national government. It’s a positive correlation. The actual correlation, as measured by Pearson’s \\(r\\) is: # calculate correlation cor(smaller_df$`Freedom to make life choices`, smaller_df$`Confidence in national government`) ## [1] 0.4419082 You will do a lot more of this kind of thing during the lab. Looking at the graph you might start to wonder: Does freedom to make life choices cause changes how confident people are in their national government? Our does it work the other way? Does being confident in your national government give you a greater sense of freedom to make life choices? Or, is this just a random relationship that doesn’t mean anything? All good questions. These data do not provide the answers, they just suggest a possible relationship. 3.4 Interpreting correlations What does the presence or the absence of a correlation between two measures mean? How should correlations be interpreted? What kind of inferences can be drawn from correlations? These are all very good questions. A first piece of advice is to use caution when interpreting correlations. Perhaps you have heard that correlation does not equal causation. There are lots of reasons why not. However, before listing some of the reasons, let’s start with a case where we would expect a causal connection between two measurements. Consider buying a snake plant for your home. Snake plants are supposed to be easy to take care of because you can mostly ignore them. Like most plants, snake plants need some water to stay alive. However, they also need just the right amount of water. Imagine an experiment where 1000 snake plants were grown in a house. Each snake plant is given a different amount of water per day, from zero teaspoons of water per day to 1000 teaspoons of water per day. We will assume that water is part of the causal process that allows snake plants to grow. The amount of water given to each snake plant per day is our first measure. Imagine further that every week the experimenter measures snake plant growth, which will be the second measurement. Now, can you imagine for yourself what a scatter plot of weekly snake plant growth by tablespoons of water would look like? 3.4.1 Causation without correlation The first plant given no water at all would have a very hard time and eventually die. It should have the least amount of weekly growth. How about the plants given only a few teaspoons of water per day. This could be just enough water to keep the plants alive, so they will grow a little bit but not a lot. If you are imagining a scatter plot, with each dot being a snake plant, then you should imagine some dots starting in the bottom left hand corner (no water &amp; no plant growth), moving up and to the right (a bit of water, and a bit of growth). As we look at snake plants getting more and more water, we should see more and more plant growth, right? But only up to a point… There’s a likely positive correlation with increasing plant growth as amount of water per day increases. But, what happens when you give snake plants too much water? From personal experience, they tend to die. So, at some point, the dots in the scatter plot will start moving back down again. Snake plants that get way too much water will not grow very well. The imaginary scatter plot you should be envisioning could have an upside U shape. Going from left to right, the dot’s go up, they reach a maximum, then they go down again reaching a minimum. Computing Pearson’s \\(r\\) for data like this gives you \\(r\\) values close to zero, while the scatter plot could look something like this: Figure 3.5: Illustration of a possible relationship between amount of water and snake plant growth. Growth goes up with water, but eventually goes back down as too much water makes snake plants die. Granted this looks more like an inverted V, than an inverted U, but you get the picture right? There is clearly a relationship between watering and snake plant growth. But, the relationship isn’t in one direction. As a result, when we compute the correlation in terms of Pearson’s r, we get a value very close to 0, suggesting no relationship. cor(growth,water) ## [1] -0.003107585 What this really means is there is no linear relationship that can be described by a single straight line. When we need lines or curves going in more than one direction, we have a nonlinear relationship. This example illustrates some conundrums in interpreting correlations. We already know that water is needed for plants to grow, so we are rightly expecting there to be a relationship between our measure of amount of water and plant growth. If we look at the first half of the data we see a positive correlation, if we look at the last half of the data we see a negative correlation, and if we look at all of the data we see no correlation. Yikes. So, even when there is a causal connection between two measures, we won’t necessarily obtain clear evidence of the connection just by computing a correlation coefficient. Note: This is one reason why plotting your data is so important. If you see an upside U shape pattern, then a correlation is probably not the best way of analyzing your data. 3.4.2 Third variables Anybody can correlate any two things that can be quantified and measured. For example, we could find a hundred people, ask them all sorts of questions like: how happy are you how old are you how tall are you how much money do you make per year how long are your eyelashes how many books have you read in your life how loud is your inner voice Let’s say we found a positive correlation between yearly salary and happiness. Note: we could have just as easily computed the same correlation between happiness and yearly salary. If we found a correlation, would you be willing to infer that yearly salary causes happiness? Perhaps it does play a part. But, something like happiness probably has a lot of contributing causes. Money could directly cause some people to be happy. But, more likely, money buys people access to all sorts of things, and some of those things might contribute happiness. These “other” things are called third variables. For example, perhaps people living in nicer places in more expensive houses are more happy than people in worse places in cheaper houses. In this scenario, money isn’t causing happiness, it’s the places and houses that money buys. But, even is this were true, people can still be more or less happy in lots of different situations. A more absurd example comes from the (seemingly) very strong correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks: Figure 3.6: A relationship between ice cream sales and shark attacks? Data obtained here. If you were to calculate the correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks you would find a value close to 1. In fact, that’s what I did and I found a correlation of 0.79, indicating a very strong positive relationship between the two variables. Are sharks allergic to ice cream and taking out their frustration on random swimmers-by? Should we ban ice cream in beach towns for public safety reasons? What is going on? Here, as well, the relationship is better explained by a third variable that wasn’t measured: during hot weather people are more likely to buy ice cream and also more likely to go swimming, increasing the overall likelihood of being attacked by a shark. The lesson here is that a correlation can occur between two measures because of a third variable that is not directly measured. So, just because we find a correlation, does not mean we can conclude anything about a causal connection between two measurements. 3.5 Relationships between variables These ideas lie at the core of empirical research. To enhance our understanding, we will develop an analytical framework which will help us see the various ways three variables might be related to each other. Causal relationships can occur either directly or indirectly. As the names suggest, a direct causal relationship refers to the un-intervening impact of one variable on another, whereas an indirect causal relationship refers to the intervening impact of one variable on another. For example, the direct causal relationship between salary and happiness can be understood as the intrinsic value of money in one’s level of happiness. In contrast, if it turns out that a salary increase makes people happier because they can consume more, the causal relationship is indirect, since consumption lies in-between the independent and dependent variable. In other words, consumption is an intervening variable. The figures below visualize this idea: Figure 3.7: Direct and indirect relationships between salary and happiness. However, things might not be as simple as the figures above suggest. In fact, researchers are usually confronted with a multitude of associations operating at the same time. Think of the example above. What would be the most accurate representation of the association between salary and happiness? Could a direct and indirect effect operate simultaneously? Most likely yes! Could there be several indirect effects operating simultaneously? Again, most likely yes! Figure 3.8: Simultaneous direct and multiple indirect effects between salary and happiness. Direct and indirect relationships only partially describe what is going on behind the scenes when researchers evaluate hypotheses. In some of your previous courses, you might have encountered the term alternative explanations. An alternative explanation is an explanation not accounted for by the researcher (hence alternative) and can bias the conclusions of the study. We will use the term confounder to refer to variables that generate alternative explanations. To better understand the function of confounders and how they differ from intervening variables, we will visualize a simple analytical framework that will allow us to understand the various ways three (or more) variables might be related to each other. We start with the example above and then generalize. What could potentially bias our efforts to estimate the causal relationship between salary and happiness? In other words, what could be a confounder? Let’s think about one’s level of education. If you attend college, you will likely end up with a higher salary. At the same time, the experience of attending college can help you develop certain personality traits, such as resilience and confidence, which in turn might affect happiness. Let’s visualize what we just said: Figure 3.9: College education as a confounder of salary and happiness. Notice the difference between the role of college education in this example and the role of consumption in the example prior (Figure 3.7). We should always pay attention to how a third variable \\(Z\\) might relate to the independent variable \\(X\\) (salary) and the dependent variable \\(Y\\) (happiness): if \\(X\\) affects \\(Z\\) which in turn affects \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\) is an intervening variable and the whole path can be described as an indirect causal relationship. If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are affected by \\(Z\\), \\(Z\\) is a confounder and the path can be described as a spurious relationship. Why spurious? Because, if the researcher does not consider whether an individual has attended college education or not, they will mistakenly interpret the observed correlation between salary and happiness as evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the two, where in fact both are driven by something else. Let’s put everything we have discussed so far in an example together. The following diagram represents a direct and indirect causal relationship with a spurious component. Figure 3.10: Simultaneous direct and multiple indirect effects between salary and happiness with college education as a confounder. As you may have guessed, the more variables we end up including in our conceptual representation of our research, the more complex our diagrams will be. However, the following key ideas remain the same as the researcher should always try to specify: whether relationships between variables are presumed to be causal or spurious; whether causal relationships are expected to be direct or indirect; the mechanisms (i.e. intervening variables) underlying any indirect causal relationship. Any relationship between two variables will consist of two components: a causal component (the one we try to uncover) and a spurious component (the one we try to eliminate). The value of this exercise rests on our ability to articulate our research question and the most plausible line of explanation: the more accurate our understanding of empirical reality, the more likely it will be to get closer to the true causal relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). 3.6 Establishing causal relationships We will further explore how to establish causal relationships using research design techniques with a motivating example from economics. Economists have long theorized about the importance of human capital on productivity. The widely held belief is that investments in human capital result in productivity growth (Becker 2009). Suppose we would like to establish this relationship with an empirical study using quantitative methods. Where do we start? Let’s first unpack the theory posed by economists: “investments in human capital result in productivity growth”. What is meant by human capital? Human capital are basically all personality traits and individual characteristics embodied in the ability to perform labor that produces economic value. For example: your habits, knowledge, social skills, analytical skills, creativity and many more individual characteristics. Then, what is meant by productivity? Productivity reflects the amount of output one unit of input can produce. Since we are talking about humans, productivity can be thought of as labor productivity, or the output of one hour of work. So far, so good. Since we want to conduct an empirical study on the relationship between human capital and productivity, we need to operationalize these concepts to enable measurement of them. Suppose we operationalize human capital with education and productivity with hourly wage. Now, we could investigate an observation like: college graduates enjoy high hourly wages. Can we use this observation to claim a causal relationship between having a college degree (human capital) and hourly wages (productivity)? Clearly not, the observation itself provides no evidence in support of the claim. As long as we do not have a comparative framework in place, we are not able to eliminate alternative explanations of the apparent relationship between having a college degree and earning a high hourly wage. 3.6.1 A frame of reference It becomes clear that unless we look at hourly wages of both college and non-college graduates we are not able to say anything about the association between the two: it is the difference in the hourly wages between the two groups that provides evidence regarding the alleged effect of college education on hourly wages. But we can probably do better than comparing just the two groups. Perhaps, the type of education might portray our effect of interest more accurately. For instance, we could compare hourly wages across college graduates of economics, political science, law, life science and non-college graduates. Our research design will look as follows: \\(X\\) \\(Y\\) Economics Hourly wage Political science Hourly wage Law Hourly wage Life science Hourly wage Non-college Hourly wage We can take this further by looking at productivity growth for different college and non-college graduates. If we understand productivity growth as the rate at which productivity grows over time, or in our example the rate at which hourly wages increase over time, we could track the rate at which hourly wages increase for economics, political science, law, and life science college graduates and compare them with non-college graduates: \\(X\\) \\(Y_1\\) \\(Y_2\\) \\(Y_3\\) Economics Hourly wage Hourly wage Hourly wage Political science Hourly wage Hourly wage Hourly wage Law Hourly wage Hourly wage Hourly wage Life science Hourly wage Hourly wage Hourly wage Non-college Hourly wage Hourly wage Hourly wage Note that time might as well appear in our research design in a slightly different flavor. What if we look at how much the hourly wage of non-college graduates changed after attending college education? In other words, we can compare the hourly wages of the same individuals before and after attending college. At this point we need to introduce some additional terminology. Let us name the measurement of hourly wages before college education as pre-test, the measurement of hourly wages after college education as post-test and the act of attending college education as the intervention. Our research design will look as follows: Pre-test (\\(Y_1\\)) Intervention (\\(X\\)) Post-test (\\(Y_2\\)) Group of individuals Hourly wage College education Hourly wage Of course, we could do the same thing and also keeping track of the type of education. The research design will look as follows: Pre-test (\\(Y_1\\)) Intervention (\\(X\\)) Post-test (\\(Y_2\\)) Economics Hourly wage College education Hourly wage Political science Hourly wage College education Hourly wage Law Hourly wage College education Hourly wage Life science Hourly wage College education Hourly wage Non-college Hourly wage College education Hourly wage It is of course possible to expand on this and make even larger and more complicated research designs that will allow you to uncover a more detailed effect. Nevertheless, it will always be the case that you have to compare some groups with some other groups. This raises our next important question: under what conditions are comparisons meaningful? 3.7 Meaningful comparisons Making meaningful comparisons is central to any research design. We must ensure that any comparison allows us to estimate the true causal effect of the relationship that we are interested in. We already know the general condition that would allow for this: alternative explanations must be eliminated. Alternative explanations are grounded on confounders which are variables affecting both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (Figure 3.9). In our example: a confounder could have both an impact on an individual’s choice to attend college education (or the type of college education) and on the hourly wage. Perhaps, intrinsic motivation for success in life is a driving force behind the decision to enroll in college and one’s performance in the labor market (thereby one’s hourly wage). What about family background? It is plausible that well educated parents can support their children financially and through networking opportunities, thereby affecting both enrollment in college education and compensation in the labor market. We will discuss two strategies for maximizing the comparability of groups below and they both rely on the same key principle: making sure confounders are not systematically different across groups. 3.7.1 Randomization The simplest and most effective way to ensure the comparability of the groups is to randomly allocate people to different groups. Random assignment of individuals to different groups means that differences with respect to individual background characteristics are random and not systematic. Therefore, if groups are large enough, they should be comparable on both known and unknown factors. For instance, in the binary classification of college and non-college education, random assignment would produce two groups with very similar intrinsic motivation, family background, innate ability and any other factor that might be related to our study. But… can we do such a thing in this particular example? Is random assignment to different educational groups possible? No, it is not! Education is a choice variable, thereby it almost by definition correlates with individual characteristics which are by themselves important in the labor market. In fact, it is precisely for this reason that it has proven to be notoriously difficult to estimate the true causal effect of education on hourly wages (Fuente 2011; Kampelmann et al. 2018). Economists have spent years developing advanced econometric techniques allowing them to overcome the fact that people are not randomly allocated in different educational groups. Before we discuss research design techniques for making meaningful comparisons when randomization is not possible, let us first look at an example where randomization is possible. Pharmaceutical companies need to test their products before administering them to the population. They also want to measure the effectiveness and side effects of various types of treatments. In this particular case it is easy, at least from a practical point of view, to randomly allocate people in various groups. The researcher is in full control and can actively manipulate the levels of the independent variable. For example, we could administer treatment A to group A, treatment B to group B and nothing to group C and random allocation will ensure that groups A, B and C are similar in terms of background characteristics that might have an impact on the effectiveness of the treatment. Therefore, through random allocation, we make sure that group differences in the dependent variable \\(Y\\) can be attributed to the treatment and not confounders. 3.7.2 Matching How can we meaningfully compare groups when allocation is a matter of individual choice? Through a procedure that by convention is called matching, researchers can deliberately match the characteristics of individuals in one group with those of individuals in another group. For example, we would like to compare hourly wages of college and non-college graduates with similar intrinsic motivation and family backgrounds, if we believe that these two factors are important determinants of hourly wages. Perhaps you can already see why this procedure is inferior to randomization. Even though we might be able to accurately operationalize family background through parents’ income and educational level, it is hard to measure intrinsic motivation. In addition, matching can only eliminate alternative explanations rooted in the confounders that are known to us, but it leaves the door open to confounders not known to us. 3.8 Taxonomy of research design The discussion so far has identified six core elements of research design. In fact, any research design, no matter how simple or complex, will always be some mix of these elements. So, let us summarize what we have seen so far by listing the six dimensions of research design: The number of groups in the design: designs vary from those with only 2 groups, to those with more. In principle, there is no upper limit to the number of groups a design might contain. However, one should not be willing to increase the level of complexity at the expense of interpretability: the simpler the design, the clearer the interpretation of the results. The number of pre-test measurement phases: designs vary from those with no pre-test (i.e. when measurements are obtained only once) to those with a series of pre-tests aiming to establish pre-existing differences between the groups that are being compared against each other. The number of post-tests measurements: designs need to have at least one post-test (i.e. when measurements are obtained only once) to those with a series of post-tests aiming to distinguish between short- and long-term effects. The method of allocation to groups: designs might employ randomization or matching. The nature of the intervention: in research design language, the terms intervention and independent variable refer to the same thing: the variable that is presumed to be causing changes in the outcome (dependent) variable11. Interventions can be either active or passive. A pharmaceutical company interested in the effectiveness of a newly developed drug employs an active intervention, since they can decide who gets what variation of treatment and randomly allocate people to different groups. A passive (or naturally occurring) intervention is when the researcher does not actively control the intervention. For example: the retirement of an individual when we want to study the effect of retirement on depression, or when a local government issues a new policy reform and we want to study its effect on employment rates. Finally, levels of the independent variable can also be (relatively) fixed attributes, such as income, education, age or sex. The number of interventions: designs with an intervention can have either one or more interventions. Multiple interventions can be used to elicit the cumulative effect of various treatments. 3.9 Range of research design Now that we have summarized the six building blocks of research design, it is time to explore the combinations of the possibilities created by combining these building blocks. We will focus on three of the most fundamental types of research design: experimental, longitudinal and cross-sectional designs. They are the foundation of more elaborate and complex research designs. They also help us understand the importance and relevance of the six core principles identified before12. 3.9.1 Experimental designs The classic version of the experimental design satisfies the following: One pre-test measurement of the outcome variable. Two groups: one group is exposed to the intervention (usually called the experimental group) and one that is not exposed to the intervention (usually called the control group). E.g. the group receiving a new drug is the experimental group. Random allocation to groups before the pre-test: this implies that only active interventions can be tested through an experimental design. One intervention (test/treatment). One post-test measure of the outcome variable. The key feature of experimental research is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies something (\\(X\\)), and then allows the outcome variable (\\(Y\\)) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the something in the world to see if it has any causal effects on the outcome. Moreover, in order to ensure that there’s no chance that something other than the manipulated variable is causing the outcome, everything else is kept constant or in some other way “balanced” to ensure no effect on the results. In practice, it’s almost impossible to think of everything that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. As we have seen already, the standard solution to this is randomization: that is, we randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the independent variables). Randomization minimizes, but does not eliminate, the possibility of systematic differences between treatment groups. Let’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don’t smoke and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment, since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over who is and isn’t a smoker. And this really matters: for instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So, it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, not by smoking per se. In research design terms, these other things (e.g. diet) are confounders. In the meantime, let’s now consider what a proper experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn’t. Specifically, if we randomly divide participants into two groups, and force half of them to become smokers, it’s very unlikely that the groups will differ in any respect other than the fact that half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re murderers. Allocation Group Pre-test Intervention (\\(X\\)) Post-test Effect Random Experimental \\(Y\\text{e}_1\\) “Treatment” (smoking) \\(Y\\text{e}_2\\) E = \\(Y\\text{e}_2 - Y\\text{e}_1\\) Random Control \\(Y\\text{c}_1\\) “No treatment” (not smoking) \\(Y\\text{c}_2\\) C = \\(Y\\text{c}_2 - Y\\text{c}_1\\) T = E - C Data obtained from this experimental design can be analyzed by taking the difference between post-test and pre-test measure in both the experimental and control group. Then, we subtract the rate of change in the control group (C) from the rate of change in the experimental group (E) to calculate the total effect of the intervention (T). If the change in the experimental group is greater than the change in the control group the researcher can attribute this to the impact of the “treatment”, to the extent that randomization was successful and alternative explanations were successfully eliminated. 3.9.2 Longitudinal designs The most basic form of the longitudinal design looks as follows: One group One pre-test measurement of the outcome variable One intervention where everyone receives the treatment (hence one group only) One post-test measurement of the outcome variable (though normally you see more than one) Allocation Pre-test Intervention (\\(X\\)) Post-test Effect Random \\(Y\\text{pre}\\) “Treatment” \\(Y\\text{post}\\) \\(Y\\text{post} - Y\\text{pre}\\) This design is similar to the classic experimental design without a control group. Data obtained from such a design is analyzed by looking at the difference between post-test and pre-test measurements. The implicit assumption here is that any difference between \\(Y\\text{post}\\) and \\(Y\\text{pre}\\) is attributed to the treatment. However, the absence of a randomized control group makes it difficult to rule out the possibility that a similar difference would have been observed in the absence of a treatment. 3.9.3 Cross-sectional designs The most basic form of the cross-sectional design satisfies the following: There is no intervention, in the sense that variation in the independent variable relies on existing differences between groups. There is at least one independent variable with at least two categories The outcome variable is measured only once There is no random allocation to groups Allocation Group Pre-test Intervention (\\(X\\)) Post-test Effect Non-random Experimental none “Treatment” \\(Ye_{post}\\) E = \\(Ye_{post}\\) Non-random Control none “No treatment” \\(Yc_{post}\\) C = \\(Yc_{post}\\) T = E - C This research design resembles a classic experimental design without a pre-test, and individuals are not randomly allocated to groups. Data are collected at one point in time only and analyzed by measuring to what extent variation in the independent variable matches the variation in the outcome variable. The absence of random allocation poses certain limitations to our efforts to interpret this association as evidence of causality. To overcome this difficulty, researchers employ a technique called statistical controls whereby associations between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are measured by keeping the values of some other relevant factor constant, eliminating it as a source of alternative explanations. Statistical controls, thus, work in a way similar to matching, but are implemented after data have been collected as long as we have access to the necessary information. The most common example of a cross-sectional design is data obtained through surveys where, for example, individual preferences on certain topics are measured at one point in time. There are many such databases publicly available on the internet and you can easily download the data they provide. The European Social Survey or the General Social Survey in the US are examples of cross-sectional designs. These surveys measure individual preferences on a wide range of sociopolitical values. So, one might be able to estimate the association between gender and political preferences. Since these surveys include questions on education, income and occupation the researcher is also able to statistically control for such factors in their efforts to get closer to the true causal effect of interest. 3.10 The validity of your study More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. We explored validity before, when it referred to the validity of our measurement. Here, we discuss the validity of a study or experimental validity. The conceptual idea behind experimental validity is very simple: can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, while it’s easy to state, in practice it’s much harder to check. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what experimental validity actually is. In fact, there’s lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises it’s own issues, and not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. I’m going to talk about three different types: Internal validity External validity Construct validity Internal and external validity are really important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. Construct validity asks whether you’re measuring what you think you are. 3.10.1 Internal validity Internal validity refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you’re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first year students, ask them to write a 1000 word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more of a university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except… the big problem that you have with this experiment is that the third-year students are older, and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is: do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because your study doesn’t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables. 3.10.2 External validity External validity relates to the generalizability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study. To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup. So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalize to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external validity. The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers don’t care only about psychology students; they care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psych students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity. That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them different to the general populace in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity. That said, it is absolutely critical to realize that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. I’ll talk about this again later, but it’s such a common mistake that I’m going to mention it here. The external validity is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psych students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population, in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicized part is the bit that lots of people forget: it is true that psychology undergraduates differ from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses only psych students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon that you’re studying, then there’s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete, here’s two extreme examples: You want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity. You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is very unlikely to have a problem with external validity. Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants (since that’s the big issue that everyone tends to worry most about), it’s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing: People might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reflect what they would do in real life. Your lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life. 3.10.3 Construct validity Construct validity is basically a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn’t. To give very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose I’m trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students, 0 people claim to be cheaters. So I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is 0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my measure is that while I’m trying to measure “the proportion of people who cheat” what I’m actually measuring is “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same thing! So my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct validity. 3.11 Threats to experimental validity If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion, the two biggest worries that we have are confounds and artifacts. We have already discussed confounds but let us summarize what we have seen by examining their relationship with artifacts. These two terms are defined in the following way: Confound: A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it, etc. Artifact: A result is said to be “artifactual” if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artifact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalize your results to the actual population that you care about. As a general rule confounds are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely because they’re not proper experiments: by definition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there’s a lot of scope for confounds working their way into your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounds: the more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounds from appearing. However, there’s always swings and roundabouts, and when we start thinking about artifacts rather than confounds, the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artifactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realize that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounds) but because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild” you reduce the chances of getting an artifactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different than you wanted to study: which is more or less the definition of an artifact. So, normally there is a tradeoff between internal and external validity: maximizing one comes at the expense of the other. Be warned though: the above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounds in an experiment, and to get artifactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is researcher error. In practice, it’s really hard to think everything through ahead of time, and even very good researchers make mistakes. But other times it’s unavoidable, simply because the researcher has ethics (e.g., see differential attrition below). Okay. There’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterized as a confound or an artifact: they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most common examples… 3.11.1 History effects History effects refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study itself that might influence the outcomes. For instance, something might happen in between a pre-test and a post-test. Or, in between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at an older study, which was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects: You’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you’re still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland (Australia) floods occurred in January 2011, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 express quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the “true” beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both: the Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December. You’re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g., by self-report, and taking physiological measures, let’s say), then you administer the drug, and then you take the same measures afterwards. In the middle, however, because your labs are in Los Angeles, there’s an earthquake, which increases the anxiety of the participants. 3.11.2 Maturation effects As with history effects, maturational effects are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren’t in response to specific events. Rather, they relate to how people change on their own over time: we get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects: When doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3 year olds. One thing that you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day), all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, then you won’t be able to tell if your educational trick works. When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours), it’s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired, and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline, regardless of anything else going on in the experiment. 3.11.3 Repeated testing effects An important type of history effect is the effect of repeated testing. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the “event” that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include: Learning and practice: e.g., “intelligence” at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve “intelligence-test-style” questions during the first testing session. Familiarity with the testing situation: e.g., if people are nervous at time 1, this might make performance go down; after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they’ve seen what the testing looks like. Auxiliary changes caused by testing: e.g., if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring, then mood at measurement at time 2 is more likely to become “bored”, precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1. 3.11.4 Selection bias Selection bias is a pretty broad term. Suppose that you’re running an experiment with two groups of participants, where each group gets a different “treatment”, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen, but trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then you’re in a lot of trouble. Another good example of selection bias is the one we discussed earlier on education and hourly wages. Education is a choice variable since people allocate themselves in different educational groups: the alternative explanation originates to the extent to which factors driving people’s educational choices correlate with their competitiveness in the labor market. 3.11.5 Differential attrition One quite subtle danger to be aware of is called differential attrition, which is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, I manage to find the perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. I start running “Thomas’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” on my perfect sample, but then, because my study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. I can’t stop this: participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that “Thomas’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” has a very high drop out rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this drop out is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly, the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom etc than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that I care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of my results. When thinking about the effects of differential attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is homogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example I gave above, the differential attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all of the conditions in my experiment at about the same rate. In general, the main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry that you’ll have is that the generalisability of the results decreases: in other words, you lose external validity. The second type of differential attrition is heterogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. This is a much bigger problem: not only do you have to worry about your external validity, you also have to worry about your internal validity too. To see why this is the case, let’s consider a very dumb study in which I want to see if insulting people makes them act in a more obedient way. Why anyone would actually want to study that I don’t know, but let’s suppose I really, deeply cared about this. So, I design my experiment with two conditions. In the “treatment” condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the “control” condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let’s have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face, I tend to get much less co-operative. So, there’s a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this drop out isn’t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be the people who don’t care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, we’ve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study insulting people doesn’t make them more obedient: it makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot. 3.11.6 Non-response bias Non-response bias is closely related to selection bias and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people, and only 300 of them reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don’t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalize from those 300 people who replied, to the population at large; since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big deal: probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here is what’s called the problem of missing data. If the data that is missing was “lost” randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem. 3.11.7 Regression to the mean Regression to the mean is a curious variation on selection bias. It refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the measure has natural variation, it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement, that later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance. Here’s an example. Suppose I’m interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psych I students with the best high school grades and look at how well they’re doing at university. It turns out that they’re doing a lot better than average, but they’re not topping the class at university, even though they did top their classes at high school. What’s going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it’s more likely that what you’re seeing is an example of “regression to the mean”. To see how it works, let’s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you’ve got a big class, there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your idiosyncratic skills, and you have to not make any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that’s the thing: intelligence and hard work are transferrable from one class to the next. Luck isn’t. The people who got lucky in high school won’t be the same as the people who get lucky at university. That’s the very definition of “luck”. The consequence of this is that, when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), you’re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn’t transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids, their children will tend to be taller than average, but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents: two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement, people tended to do worse; but after the negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But! Notice that there’s a selection bias here: when people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should expect (because of regression to the mean) that performance on the next trial should be worse, regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artifact caused by regression to the mean (Kahneman and Tversky 1973). 3.11.8 Experimenter bias Experimenter bias can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally end up influencing the results of the experiment by subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not – either the right answer to the questions being asked, or knowledge of the expected pattern of performance for the condition that the participant is in, and so on. The classic example of this happening is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to 1907 (Pfungst 1911; Hothersall 2004). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count, and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It turned out that – not surprisingly – Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him. Because they did know how to count, and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed theirs. The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in, or knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but it’s important to recognize that it’s not quite ideal, and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that I could try to construct a double blind study is to have one of my Ph.D. students (one who doesn’t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (me) who knows all the details (e.g., correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the Ph.D. student) doesn’t know anything. Except, that last part is very unlikely to be true. In order for the Ph.D. student to run the study effectively, they need to have been briefed by me, the researcher. And, as it happens, the Ph.D. student also knows me, and knows a bit about my general beliefs about people and psychology (e.g., I tend to think humans are much smarter than psychologists give them credit for). As a result of all this, it’s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid knowing a little bit about what expectations I have. And even a little bit of knowledge can have an effect: suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys the fact that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, there’s a thing called the “Pygmalion effect”: if you expect great things of people, they’ll rise to the occasion; but if you expect them to fail, they’ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 3.11.9 Demand effects and reactivity When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter’s knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants, and that these affect people’s behaviour (Rosenthal 1966). However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching/studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as reactivity or demand effects. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne effect: people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from a the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of Chicago (Adair 1984). A study done in the 1920s looking at the effects of lighting on worker productivity at the factory turned out to be an effect of the fact that the workers knew they were being studied, rather than the lighting. To get a bit more specific about some of the ways in which the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the roles that people might adopt during an experiment, but might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world: The good participant tries to be too helpful to the researcher: he or she seeks to figure out the experimenter’s hypotheses and confirm them. The negative participant does the exact opposite of the good participant: he or she seeks to break or destroy the study or the hypothesis in some way. The faithful participant is unnaturally obedient: he or she seeks to follow instructions perfectly, regardless of what might have happened in a more realistic setting. The apprehensive participant gets nervous about being tested or studied, so much so that his or her behaviour becomes highly unnatural, or overly socially desirable. 3.11.10 Placebo effects The placebo effect is a specific type of demand effect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials: if you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that it’s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren’t treated at all. In other words, it is people’s belief that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug. 3.12 That’s it for this week Whew. That’s it for the readings of the third week. It is perfectly normal if you feel that all this information is overwhelming and perhaps to some extent redundant. However, by discussing all these threats the aim is to explore different flavors of the same key principles, hoping that the examples of different manifestations will make it easier for you to identify various threats in yours’ or others’ studies. You have the opportunity to refine your critical skills by reading some mini case-studies on SOIWSO and trying to identify, if any, relevant threats to internal validity.
