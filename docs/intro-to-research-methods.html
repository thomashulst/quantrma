<p>In this chapter, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas that go into designing a study, collecting data, checking whether your data collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough information to allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of the basic tools that you need to assess the studies done by other people. However, since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note that this chapter is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more psychology-specific than the later parts of this book. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the problem in a little detail. This section relies heavily on <span class="citation">Campbell and Stanley (<a href="#ref-Campbell1963" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>)</span> for the discussion of study design, and <span class="citation">Stevens (<a href="#ref-Stevens1946" role="doc-biblioref">1946</a>)</span> for the discussion of scales of measurement.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Some thoughts about measurement</h2>
<p>The first thing to understand is data collection can be thought of as a kind of <strong>measurement</strong>. That is, in psychological research, what we’re trying to do is measure something about human behaviour. What do I mean by “measurement”?</p>
<p>Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of well-defined descriptions to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count as a psychological measurement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My <span><strong>age</strong></span> is <span><em>33 years</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>I <span><em>do not</em></span> <span><strong>like anchovies</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>My <span><strong>chromosomal gender</strong></span> is <span><em>male</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>My <span><strong>self-identified gender</strong></span> is <span><em>male</em></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the short list above, the <span><strong>bolded part</strong></span> is “the thing to be measured”, and the <span><em>italicized part</em></span> is “the measurement itself”. In fact, we can expand on this a little bit, by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My <span><strong>age</strong></span> (in years) could have been <span><em>0, 1, 2, 3 …</em></span>, etc. The upper bound on what my age could possibly be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice you’d be safe in saying that the largest possible age is <span><em>150</em></span>, since no human has ever lived that long.</p></li>
<li><p>When asked if I <span><strong>like anchovies</strong></span>, I might have said that <span><em>I do</em></span>, or <span><em>I do not</em></span>, or <span><em>I have no opinion</em></span>, or <span><em>I sometimes do</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>My <span><strong>chromosomal gender</strong></span> is almost certainly going to be <span><em>male (XY)</em></span> or <span><em>female (XX)</em></span>, but there are a few other possibilities. I could also have <span><em>Klinfelter’s syndrome (XXY)</em></span>, which is more similar to male than to female. And I imagine there are other possibilities too.</p></li>
<li><p>My <span><strong>self-identified gender</strong></span> is also very likely to be <span><em>male</em></span> or <span><em>female</em></span>, but it doesn’t have to agree with my chromosomal gender. I may also choose to identify with <span><em>neither</em></span>, or to explicitly call myself <span><em>transgender</em></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a bit tricky. But I want to point out that even in the case of someone’s age, it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above, I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you’re a developmental psychologist, that’s way too crude, and so you often measure age in <span><em>years and months</em></span> (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in <span><em>days since birth</em></span>, maybe even <span><em>hours since birth</em></span>. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is important.</p>
<p>Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of “age” isn’t actually all that precise. In general, when we say “age” we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that “birth” is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In one sense, yes: by social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world, but from a scientific perspective that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it’s often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of time since conception, and the length of time since birth. When dealing with adults, it won’t make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it might.</p>
<p>Moving beyond these issues, there’s the question of methodology. What specific “measurement method” are you going to use to find out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could just ask people “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age.</p></li>
<li><p>You could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) “how old is your child?” This method is fast, and when dealing with kids it’s not all that hard since the parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception”, since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g., an obstetrician).</p></li>
<li><p>You could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time consuming and annoying, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now dead).</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="operationalization-defining-your-measurement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Operationalization: defining your measurement</h3>
<p>All of the ideas discussed in the previous section all relate to the concept of <strong>operationalization</strong>. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalization is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept, and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of operationalization can involve several different things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being precise about what you are trying to measure: For instance, does “age” mean “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research?</p></li>
<li><p>Determining what method you will use to measure it: Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you’re using self-report, how will you phrase the question?</p></li>
<li><p>Defining the set of the allowable values that the measurement can take: Note that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, hours? Etc. For other types of measurements (e.g., gender), the values aren’t numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only “male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people any specific options, and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Operationalization is a tricky business, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. The way in which you choose to operationalize the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often you’ll find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalization needs to be thought through on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general.</p>
<p>Before moving on, I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A theoretical construct</strong>. This is the thing that you’re trying to take a measurement of, like “age”, “gender” or an “opinion”. A theoretical construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re actually a bit vague.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A measure</strong>. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An operationalization</strong>. The term “operationalization” refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A variable</strong>. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” that we end up with in our data sets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to try to understand the differences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="assessing-the-reliability-of-a-measurement" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Assessing the reliability of a measurement</h2>
<p>At this point we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalize a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure. Now, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related ideas: <span><em>reliability</em></span> and <span><em>validity</em></span>. Put simply, the <strong>reliability</strong> of a measure tells you how <span><em>precisely</em></span> you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how <span><em>accurate</em></span> the measure is.</p>
<p>Reliability is actually a very simple concept: it refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable: if I step on and off the scales over and over again, it’ll keep giving me the same answer. Measuring my intelligence by means of “asking my mom” is very unreliable: some days she tells me I’m a bit thick, and other days she tells me I’m a complete moron. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to it’s validity). If I’m holding a sack of potatos when I step on and off of the bathroom scales, the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn’t match up to my true weight at all, therefore it’s wrong. In technical terms, this is a <span><em>reliable but invalid</em></span> measurement. Similarly, while my mom’s estimate of my intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe I’m just not too bright, and so while her estimate of my intelligence fluctuates pretty wildly from day to day, it’s basically right. So that would be an <span><em>unreliable but valid</em></span> measure. Of course, to some extent, notice that if my mum’s estimates are too unreliable, it’s going to be very hard to figure out which one of her many claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity.</p>
<p>Okay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s have a think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test-retest reliability</strong>. This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get a the same answer?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inter-rater reliability</strong>. This relates to consistency across people: if someone else repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce the same answer?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parallel forms reliability</strong>. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements: if I use a different set of bathroom scales to measure my weight, does it give the same answer?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internal consistency reliability</strong>. If a measurement is constructed from lots of different parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that I teach, <span><em>Computational Cognitive Science</em></span>, has an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is <span><em>intended</em></span> to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes; so the exam on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measure the same thing!</p>
</div>
<div id="the-role-of-variables-predictors-and-outcomes" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> The role of variables: predictors and outcomes</h2>
<p>I’ve got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you. Remember, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. Normally, when we do some research we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the other variables. It’s important to keep the two roles “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being explained” distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. Firstly, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since it’s going to happen over and over again. Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and denote the variables “doing the explaining” as <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p>Now, when we doing an analysis, we have different names for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, since they play different roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are <strong>independent variable</strong> (IV) and <strong>dependent variable</strong> (DV). The IV is the variable that you use to do the explaining (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> then we can say that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and if we have designed our study “properly” then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> isn’t dependent on anything else. However, some people have suggested these names are horrible: they’re hard to remember and they can be misleading, because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of everything else” and (b) if there’s no relationship, then the DV doesn’t actually depend on the IV. There are a number of alternatives that some people find more appealing.</p>
<p>For example, in an experiment the IV refers to the <strong>manipulation</strong>, and the DV refers to the <strong>measurement</strong>. So, we could use <strong>manipulated variable</strong> (independent variable) and <strong>measured variable</strong> (dependent variable).</p>

<p>We could also use <strong>predictors</strong> and <strong>outcomes</strong>.

<div id="assessing-the-validity-of-a-study" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Assessing the validity of a study</h2>
<p>More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. The conceptual idea behind <strong>validity</strong> is very simple: can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, while it’s easy to state, in practice it’s much harder to check validity than it is to check reliability. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there’s lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises it’s own issues, and not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. I’m going to talk about three different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal validity</p></li>
<li><p>External validity</p></li>
<li><p>Construct validity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Internal and external validity are really important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. Construct validity asks whether you’re measuring what you think you are.</p>
<div id="internal-validity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Internal validity</h3>
<p><strong>Internal validity</strong> refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you’re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first year students, ask them to write a 1000 word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more of a university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except… the big problem that you have with this experiment is that the third-year students are older, and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is: Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true <span><em>cause</em></span> of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because your study doesn’t properly tease apart the <span><em>causal</em></span> relationships between the different variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="external-validity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> External validity</h3>
<p><strong>External validity</strong> relates to the <strong>generalizability</strong> of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study. To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup. So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalize to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external validity.</p>
<p>The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers don’t care <span><em>only</em></span> about psychology students; they care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psych students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity. That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them different to the general populace in some <span><em>relevant</em></span> respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity.</p>
<p>That said, it is absolutely critical to realize that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. I’ll talk about this again later, but it’s such a common mistake that I’m going to mention it here. The external validity is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psych students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population, <span><em>in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study</em></span>. The italicized part is the bit that lots of people forget: it is true that psychology undergraduates differ from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses only psych students <span><em>may</em></span> have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon that you’re studying, then there’s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete, here’s two extreme examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is very unlikely to have a problem with external validity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants (since that’s the big issue that everyone tends to worry most about), it’s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reflect what they would do in real life.</p></li>
<li><p>Your lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="construct-validity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> Construct validity</h3>
<p><strong>Construct validity</strong> is basically a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn’t. To give very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose I’m trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students, 0 people claim to be cheaters. So I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is 0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my measure is that while I’m <span><em>trying</em></span> to measure “the proportion of people who cheat” what I’m actually measuring is “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same thing! So my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct validity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="confounds-artifacts-and-other-threats-to-validity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Confounds, artifacts and other threats to validity</h2>
<p>If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion, the two biggest worries that we have are <span><em>confounds</em></span> and <span><em>artifacts</em></span>. These two terms are defined in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Confound</strong>: A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Artifact</strong>: A result is said to be “artifactual” if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artifact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalize your results to the actual population that you care about.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule confounds are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely because they’re not proper experiments: by definition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there’s a lot of scope for confounds working their way into your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounds: the more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounds from appearing.</p>
<p>However, there’s always swings and roundabouts, and when we start thinking about artifacts rather than confounds, the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artifactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realize that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounds) but because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild” you reduce the chances of getting an artifactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different than you wanted to study: which is more or less the definition of an artifact.</p>
<p>Be warned though: the above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounds in an experiment, and to get artifactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is researcher error. In practice, it’s really hard to think everything through ahead of time, and even very good researchers make mistakes. But other times it’s unavoidable, simply because the researcher has ethics (e.g., see <a href="intro-to-research-methods.html#differential-attrition">Differential attrition</a> below).</p>
<p>Okay. There’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterized as a confound or an artifact: they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most common examples…</p>
<div id="history-effects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> History effects</h3>
<p><strong>History effects</strong> refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study itself that might influence the outcomes. For instance, something might happen in between a pre-test and a post-test. Or, in between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at an older study, which was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you’re still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland (Australia) floods occurred in January 2011, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 express quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the “true” beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both: the Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g., by self-report, and taking physiological measures, let’s say), then you administer the drug, and then you take the same measures afterwards. In the middle, however, because your labs are in Los Angeles, there’s an earthquake, which increases the anxiety of the participants.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As with history effects, <strong>maturational effects</strong> are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren’t in response to specific events. Rather, they relate to how people change on their own over time: we get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3 year olds. One thing that you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day), all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, then you won’t be able to tell if your educational trick works.</p></li>
<li><p>When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours), it’s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired, and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline, regardless of anything else going on in the experiment</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="repeated-testing-effects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3</span> Repeated testing effects</h3>
<p>An important type of history effect is the effect of <strong>repeated testing</strong>. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the “event” that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><em>Learning and practice</em></span>: e.g., “intelligence” at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve “intelligence-test-style” questions during the first testing session.</p></li>
<li><p><span><em>Familiarity with the testing situation</em></span>: e.g., if people are nervous at time 1, this might make performance go down; after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they’ve seen what the testing looks like.</p></li>
<li><p><span><em>Auxiliary changes caused by testing</em></span>: e.g., if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring, then mood at measurement at time 2 is more likely to become “bored”, precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="selection-bias" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.4</span> Selection bias</h3>
<p><strong>Selection bias</strong> is a pretty broad term. Suppose that you’re running an experiment with two groups of participants, where each group gets a different “treatment”, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen, but trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then you’re in a lot of trouble.</p>
</div>
<div id="differential-attrition" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.5</span> Differential attrition</h3>
<p>One quite subtle danger to be aware of is called <strong>differential attrition</strong>, which is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, I manage to find the perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. I start running “Dan’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” on my perfect sample, but then, because my study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. I can’t stop this: participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that “Dan’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” has a very high drop out rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this drop out is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly, the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom etc than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that I care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of my results.</p>
<p>When thinking about the effects of differential attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is <strong>homogeneous attrition</strong>, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example I gave above, the differential attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all of the conditions in my experiment at about the same rate. In general, the main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry that you’ll have is that the generalisability of the results decreases: in other words, you lose external validity.</p>
<p>The second type of differential attrition is <strong>heterogeneous attrition</strong>, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. This is a much bigger problem: not only do you have to worry about your external validity, you also have to worry about your internal validity too. To see why this is the case, let’s consider a very dumb study in which I want to see if insulting people makes them act in a more obedient way. Why anyone would actually want to study that I don’t know, but let’s suppose I really, deeply cared about this. So, I design my experiment with two conditions. In the “treatment” condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the “control” condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let’s have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face, I tend to get much less co-operative. So, there’s a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this drop out isn’t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be the people who don’t care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, we’ve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were <span><em>already</em></span> more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study insulting people doesn’t make them more obedient: it makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-response-bias" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.6</span> Non-response bias</h3>
<p><strong>Non-response bias</strong> is closely related to selection bias and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people, and only 300 of them reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don’t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalize from those 300 people who replied, to the population at large; since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big deal: probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here is what’s called the problem of <strong>missing data</strong>. If the data that is missing was “lost” randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="regression-to-the-mean" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.7</span> Regression to the mean</h3>
<p><strong>Regression to the mean</strong> is a curious variation on selection bias. It refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the measure has natural variation, it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement, that later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Suppose I’m interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psych I students with the best high school grades and look at how well they’re doing at university. It turns out that they’re doing a lot better than average, but they’re not topping the class at university, even though they did top their classes at high school. What’s going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it’s more likely that what you’re seeing is an example of “regression to the mean”. To see how it works, let’s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you’ve got a big class, there are going to be <span><em>lots</em></span> of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your idiosyncratic skills, and you have to not make any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that’s the thing: intelligence and hard work are transferrable from one class to the next. Luck isn’t. The people who got lucky in high school won’t be the same as the people who get lucky at university. That’s the very definition of “luck”. The consequence of this is that, when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), you’re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn’t transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean.</p>
<p>Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids, their children will tend to be taller than average, but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents: two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement, people tended to do worse; but after the negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But! Notice that there’s a selection bias here: when people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should <span><em>expect</em></span> (because of regression to the mean) that performance on the next trial should be worse, regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artifact caused by regression to the mean <span class="citation">(Kahneman and Tversky <a href="#ref-Kahneman1973" role="doc-biblioref">1973</a>)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="experimenter-bias" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.8</span> Experimenter bias</h3>
<p><strong>Experimenter bias</strong> can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally end up influencing the results of the experiment by subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not – either the right answer to the questions being asked, or knowledge of the expected pattern of performance for the condition that the participant is in, and so on. The classic example of this happening is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to 1907 <span class="citation">(Pfungst <a href="#ref-Pfungst1911" role="doc-biblioref">1911</a>; Hothersall <a href="#ref-Hothersall2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count, and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It turned out that – not surprisingly – Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him. Because they did know how to count, and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed theirs.</p>
<p>The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in, or knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but it’s important to recognize that it’s not quite ideal, and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that I could try to construct a double blind study is to have one of my Ph.D. students (one who doesn’t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (me) who knows all the details (e.g., correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the Ph.D. student) doesn’t know anything. Except, that last part is very unlikely to be true. In order for the Ph.D. student to run the study effectively, they need to have been briefed by me, the researcher. And, as it happens, the Ph.D. student also knows me, and knows a bit about my general beliefs about people and psychology (e.g., I tend to think humans are much smarter than psychologists give them credit for). As a result of all this, it’s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid knowing a little bit about what expectations I have. And even a little bit of knowledge can have an effect: suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys the fact that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, there’s a thing called the “Pygmalion effect”: if you expect great things of people, they’ll rise to the occasion; but if you expect them to fail, they’ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
</div>
<div id="demand-effects-and-reactivity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.9</span> Demand effects and reactivity</h3>
<p>When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter’s knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants, and that these effect people’s behaviour <span class="citation">(Rosenthal <a href="#ref-Rosenthal1966" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a>)</span>. However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching/studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as <strong>reactivity</strong> or <strong>demand effects</strong>. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne effect: people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from a the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of Chicago <span class="citation">(Adair <a href="#ref-Adair1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>. A study done in the 1920s looking at the effects of lighting on worker productivity at the factory turned out to be an effect of the fact that the workers knew they were being studied, rather than the lighting.</p>
<p>To get a bit more specific about some of the ways in which the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the <span><em>roles</em></span> that people might adopt during an experiment, but might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <span><em>good participant</em></span> tries to be too helpful to the researcher: he or she seeks to figure out the experimenter’s hypotheses and confirm them.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span><em>negative participant</em></span> does the exact opposite of the good participant: he or she seeks to break or destroy the study or the hypothesis in some way.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span><em>faithful participant</em></span> is unnaturally obedient: he or she seeks to follow instructions perfectly, regardless of what might have happened in a more realistic setting.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span><em>apprehensive participant</em></span> gets nervous about being tested or studied, so much so that his or her behaviour becomes highly unnatural, or overly socially desirable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="placebo-effects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.10</span> Placebo effects</h3>
<p>The <strong>placebo effect</strong> is a specific type of demand effect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials: if you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that it’s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren’t treated at all. In other words, it is people’s belief that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug.</p>
</div>
<div id="situation-measurement-and-subpopulation-effects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.11</span> Situation, measurement and subpopulation effects</h3>
<p>In some respects, these terms are a catch-all term for “all other threats to external validity”. They refer to the fact that the choice of subpopulation from which you draw your participants, the location, timing and manner in which you run your study (including who collects the data) and the tools that you use to make your measurements might all be influencing the results. Specifically, the worry is that these things might be influencing the results in such a way that the results won’t generalize to a wider array of people, places and measures.</p>
</div>
<div id="fraud-deception-and-self-deception" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.12</span> Fraud, deception and self-deception</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.</em></span><br />
</p>
<p>– Upton Sinclair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One final thing that I feel like I should mention. While reading what the textbooks often have to say about assessing the validity of the study, I couldn’t help but notice that they seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not. Not only that, as I mentioned earlier, scientists are not immune to belief bias – it’s easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, and this can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research, and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud, but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally “slanted”. I opened a few standard textbooks and didn’t find much of a discussion of this problem, so here’s my own attempt to list a few ways in which these issues can arise are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data fabrication</strong>. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with “good” intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth, and may actually reflect “slightly cleaned up” versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hoaxes</strong>. Hoaxes share a lot of similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. There’s quite a few well known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g., Piltdown man) some of were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g., the Sokal affair).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data misrepresentation</strong>. While fraud gets most of the headlines, it’s much more common in my experience to see data being misrepresented. When I say this, I’m not referring to newspapers getting it wrong (which they do, almost always). I’m referring to the fact that often, the data don’t actually say what the researchers think they say. My guess is that, almost always, this isn’t the result of deliberate dishonesty, it’s due to a lack of sophistication in the data analyses. For instance, think back to the example of Simpson’s paradox that I discussed in the beginning of these notes. It’s very common to see people present “aggregated” data of some kind; and sometimes, when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself, you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden, because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g., the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There’s a lot of variants on this; many of which are very hard to detect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Study “misdesign”</strong>. Okay, this one is subtle. Basically, the issue here is that a researcher designs a study that has built-in flaws, and those flaws are never reported in the paper. The data that are reported are completely real, and are correctly analysed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect, and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it “easy” to (artifactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this – in case you’re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself – is to design an experiment in which it’s obvious to the participants what they’re “supposed” to be doing, and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want, you can add all the trappings of double blind experimentation etc. It won’t make a difference, since the study materials themselves are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results, the fraud won’t be obvious to the reader: what’s obvious to the participant when they’re in the experimental context isn’t always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way I’ve described this makes it sound like it’s always fraud: probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but in my experience the bigger concern has been with unintentional misdesign. The researcher <span><em>believes</em></span> …and so the study just happens to end up with a built in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data mining &amp; post hoc hypothesising</strong>. Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less lie about what they found is by engaging in what’s referred to as “data mining”. As we’ll discuss later in the class, if you keep trying to analyse your data in lots of different ways, you’ll eventually find something that “looks” like a real effect but isn’t. This is referred to as “data mining”. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers, it’s becoming very common. Data mining per se isn’t “wrong”, but the more that you do it, the bigger the risk you’re taking. The thing that is wrong, and I suspect is very common, is <span><em>unacknowledged</em></span> data mining. That is, the researcher run every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often “invent” a hypothesis after looking at the data, to cover up the data mining. To be clear: it’s not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data, and to reanalyse your data using your new “post hoc” hypotheses. What is wrong (and, I suspect, common) is failing to acknowledge that you’ve done so. If you acknowledge that you did it, then other researchers are able to take your behaviour into account. If you don’t, then they can’t. And that makes your behaviour deceptive. Bad!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publication bias &amp; self-censoring</strong>. Finally, a pervasive bias is “non-reporting” of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don’t publish every article that is submitted to them: they prefer to publish articles that find “something”. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading <span><em>Finnegans Wake</em></span> causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesn’t, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, it’s the one study that did find that <span><em>Finnegans Wake</em></span> causes insanity. This is an example of a <span><em>publication bias</em></span>: since no-one ever published the 19 studies that didn’t find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers “internalize” this bias, and end up <span><em>self-censoring</em></span> their research. Knowing that negative results aren’t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of mine says “for every experiment that you get published, you also have 10 failures”. And she’s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuffed something up) others might be genuine “null” results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the “good” experiment. And telling which is which is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by <span class="citation">Ioannidis (<a href="#ref-Ioannidis2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> with the depressing title “Why most published research findings are false”. I’d also suggest taking a look at work by <span class="citation">Kühberger, Fritz, and Scherndl (<a href="#ref-Kuhberger2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that’ll do to start with. What I really want to point out is the blindingly obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists aren’t usually <span><em>that</em></span> naive, but for some reason the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype.</p>
</div>

<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Summary</h2>
<p>This chapter isn’t really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of research methods: it would require another volume just as long as this one to do justice to the topic. However, in real life statistics and study design are tightly intertwined, so it’s very handy to discuss some of the key topics. In this chapter, I’ve briefly discussed the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Introduction to measurement</strong>: What does it mean to operationalize a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability of a measurement</strong>: If I measure the “same”" thing twice, should I expect to see the same result? Only if my measure is reliable. But what does it mean to talk about doing the “same” thing? Well, that’s why we have different types of reliability. Make sure you remember what they are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Terminology: predictors and outcomes</strong>: What roles do variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? Etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validity and its threats</strong>: Does your study measure what you want it to? How might things go wrong? And is it my imagination, or was that a very long list of possible ways in which things can go wrong?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of research methodology. I built this chapter from the classic little book by <span class="citation">Campbell and Stanley (<a href="#ref-Campbell1963" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>)</span>, but there are of course a large number of textbooks out there on research design. Spend a few minutes with your favourite search engine and you’ll find dozens.</p>
